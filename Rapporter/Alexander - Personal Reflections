Weekly reflections - Alexander


Week 1


What do I want to learn or understand better?


I would like to understand quite a few things at this point. First of all I want to get more acquainted to SCRUM, and using it effectively in a group situation, so it doesn't just become something that is set aside after the first group meeting. Secondly, I would like to learn more about the objectives during this course. The lectures gave a brief introduction to how we will be assessed, but I am still uncertain regarding what the 16 specific topics in the lecture are, and how to effectively get a good grade in the course.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?


At this point, my previous knowledge of HTML programming is the only unique knowledge I can contribute to the group. I do have knowledge in java and database programming, but I read those courses together with the other group members. If I notice that someone needs or wants help, I will always offer it!


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?


At this point our group has only done a LEGO scrum exercise, where I took the role of "factory worker" and "communicator", by building one part of the product, and asking the customer details about the product.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).


My contribution towards the team so far (except the above described role in the LEGO exercise) is writing the group contract. My learning objective for next week is to learn more about scrum and use it properly, as well as get acquainted with the course litterature.

Week 2


What do I want to learn or understand better?


At the moment, I would like to learn and understand the project better. We were given an introduction to it, so I basically know that our project has to do with the effectivisation of communication between stakeholders in the marine transport business. We will improve an app in regards to a specific stakeholder that we were given. However, we have not met the stakeholder, so our entire project goal is so far unclear.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?


At this point now much is known about what we should aim towards with the project. Therefore there is not much more to do other than dig into the course literature and hopefully gain a better understanding of marine transport as well as scrum, git, and vision.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?


This week there wasn’t much new work other than learning about the project. I contributed to my teams scrumming by writing a part of the team reflection, as well as reflecting on the project introduction with my team after the course.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?


At this point we have no specific delivery goals set out. Hopefully next week we will have them, after we speak with our customer.

We will improve an app in regards to a specific stakeholder that we were given. However, we have not met the stakeholder, so our entire project goal is so far unclear. I hope that after the meeting with the client, and playing around with the source code of the original application, that things will become clearer.

Therefore there is not much more to do other than dig into the course literature and hopefully gain a better understanding of marine transport as well as scrum, git, and vision. This has not changed since last week.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?


This week there wasn’t much new work other than learning about the project. I contributed to my teams scrumming by writing a part of the team reflection, as well as reflecting on the project introduction with my team after the course, just like last week.

Week 4



What do I want to learn or understand better?


At the moment, I would like to learn and understand the project better. I have basically only played around with the app we were given to install on our computers. I basically know that our project has to do with the effectivisation of communication between stakeholders in the marine transport business, but thats nothing new since last week. We will improve an app in regards to a specific stakeholder that we were given, also old information. We have not met the stakeholder, but at least our group has made user stories, which made the project a little bit clearer for me. I hope that after the meeting with the client, and playing around with the source code of the original application togeher with the group, as well as setting up common goals and decomposing source code with the group, that things will become clearer.

At this point now much is known about what we should aim towards with the project. Therefore there is not much more to do other than dig into the course literature and hopefully gain a better understanding of marine transport as well as scrum, git, and vision. This has not changed since last week. However, I was one of the first in my group to install the app successfully, so I have helped my other groupmates install the app on their computers.



What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?


This week there wasn’t much new work other than creating user stories. I contributed to my teams scrumming by writing a part of the team reflection, as well as reflecting on the project introduction with my team after the course, just like last week.



What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 


At this point we have no specific delivery goals set out. Hopefully next week we will have them, after we speak with our customer. Hopefully we will speak to the customer next week.

Week 5:



What do I want to learn or understand better?


At the moment, I would like to learn how to understand the app better. Our group set programming deadlines for our weekly sprint, which means that it is time to learn the code and get dirty!


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?


At this point I can help my sprint teammate with the coding of our task. If we work together, there will be a mutual aid and exchange of knowledge in order to achieve the acceptance criteria of the task and reach the definitions of done in the best manner possible.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?


My contribution this week was writing a larger portion of the group reflection, and helping to try and figure out, define, and elaborate user stories, so that they have definitions of done and acceptance criteria. I have also been assigned as the programming master, which I will be doing next week.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 


My contribution as stated above, is attending group meetings, discussing user stories, acceptance criteria, and definitions of done.



-----------------------------------------------

Week 6:



What do I want to learn or understand better?


At the moment, I would like to learn how to understand the code of the app better. For this weeks sprint Adam and I were given the task to make it possible for terminal workers to assign a terminal to incoming ships via the app. However, the app has no feature names terminal, only port. The documentation given mentions nothing about terminals, and so far I have not been able to find any server API of some sort. At the moment I feel like I have to find some way to make the server create a new attribute to vessels and store it, however I have no idea how to do so.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?


At this point I have helped my teammate understand the general area of where to code our interface, and how. My knowledge in html and java can be of use, since I can explain to my team how and where the front end interface system can be coded. However, I lack the knowledge required to send and receive data, i.e. make the interface interactive.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?


My contribution to the teams application of scrum is basically the structuring of things to do for the user story assigned to me, and fulfilling one part of this (front end interface draft). I also contributed by realising that this scrum week had too hard of an assignment to be able to do it in one week. This is a contribution towards the weeks scrum reflections.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

 

My contribution this week was learning how the interface layout is structured in the app. I also created a interface draft, or MVP, of how the interface for our user story should look like.




-----------------------------------------------

Week 7:



What do I want to learn or understand better?


At the moment, I would like to learn how to create a calculator in the app. For this sprint me and Adam were assigned to a task where we have to make a calculator of the time it takes to fuel a vessel depending on the amount of fuel that will be inserted. I have never tried to code an input field in a gui before, so this will be exciting! I also want to learn the main priorities that the product owners and users have on the app, so that our group can focus on these user stories as much as possible. Time is running out.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?


At this point I can help my team by trying to organize the main tasks that are requested by the product owner and user, and try todo my best in order to make sure that these tasks are accomplished. Since the course is nearing its end, I think that it is important to focus on what matters, and be very accurate in time estimations for each task that our team does.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?


My contribution to the teams application of scrum is basically the structuring of tasks that can be done within the remaining time that our group has. This involves more detailed effort and subtask estimations, so that this scrum week will be better than the last. Last week our product user said that the feature me and Adam tried to code has a very simple work around solution in the app, while our solution would involve complex databases to handle sensitive data. Therefore our user story got prioritized down and basically scrapped, since other, easier and more needed user stories had yet to be finished. I also contributed by writing half of this weeks group reflections.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

 

My contribution this week was quite small, considering that we found out that the task I was assigned this week should be scrapped. Therefore I tried to contribute to my team by better orgaising tasks so that we will at least finish some user stories by the end of this course.




-----------------------------------------------

Week 8:



What do I want to learn or understand better?


At the moment it would be nice to learn what the other pairs of coders in the team have done. Since the upcoming week includes merging all branches of code we have written, I would like to learn how to construct the end product by merging everything. I also want to understand the aforementioned written code. In regards to my personal progress, I want to learn more about how the different code languages interact with eachother (javascript, html, etc.), and how I can use it in my future life. I want to be able to code in these languages, so remembering what I have learned during this course is a good start!


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?


The next sprint involves testing the code, where each coding pair will test another pairs code. Here I have a chance to check the code for errors, and potentially help another coding pair identify errors and ways to fix them. I can also do my best to assist the team in the merging process of all the branches.



What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

My contribution during this scrum application session was regularly attending daily scrum sessions, and weekly scrum sessions. Other than that, I performed my role of coding and writing individual and team reflections.



What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 


This past sprint week I developed the functionality of the user stories of calculating the time that it will take to fuel a vessel based on fuel amount. I did this together with my code pair teammate. We also created a new view and a button that links to the view, so that the calculator view can be conveniently accessed from a specific part of the application, as per the product owners description.
