Weekly reflection, week 1

What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to further deepen my knowledge about Scrum, in order to get a clear picture of how the project will be organized and how to utilise the Scrum framework to its fullest potential. Furthermore, I also would like to know more about the project and its scope. However, it is not possible at this time, as the introductional lecture about this will be held next Wednesday. Hopefully, we will get a interesting project to work with and to further develop our programming skills. On top of that, the project will also help me to develop further skills in cooperation with my teammates and planning and executing a bigger project. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

When the project is at its starting pits, the most useful thing I can provide my teammates with is information about Scrum and other topics relating to project work and how to organize projects. As of now, our knowledge about Scrum is scarce, and reading more about this topic and sharing it with my teammates will provide us with a still ground to stand on. Thus, with this mindset, the project can be correctly executed and planned.  

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As of right now, with the project in its starting pits, the application of scrum has not yet taken place. Therefore, I have not, in that sense, yet contributed to the team’s application of scrum. However, I have shared interesting articles about scrum and the application of it to my teammates in our chat group on Facebook. So, with that in mind, I have indirect contributed to the team’s application of scrum. I have also helped in setting up the github repository, together with my teammates. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
With this being the first reflection, and thus the first week, I have not yet achieved anything in relation to last week’s ambitions. Therefore, I will skip this part and move on to what I want to achieve next week, together with my learning objectives. 
For next week as learning objectives, I would like to further deepen my knowledge about scrum (as it is of great value to know about in order for the project to be successful), how Github works (for the project to be successful, I want to be able to use the full powers of Github to the project’s advantage) and also get to know our project’s scope (to get a clear picture of what is to come). In order to deepen my knowledge in scrum, I will read as much about it as possible. Furthemore, to learn Github, I will explore the platform as much as I can and seek out the different tools built in the platform. 
As of now, the current situation is that we do not really know what our project’s scope is. However, when that has been clarified, I will try to find out as much as possible about the subject in matter. With that as a solid ground to stand on, I will be more prepared to start the programming part of the project. 

------------------------------------------------------

Weekly reflection, week 2

What do I want to learn or understand better?

In the upcoming week, I want to be able to better understand the project, the client and how the the application PortableCDM works both. As of right now, it is not clear of what the client wants from the application. In order to develop a technical understanding of the application, I will need to look at the codebase and try to understand how everything works and also look at the behaviour of the application and relate that to the code. On top of this, I also want to start processing the goal of the application schematically and try to see opportunities of further developing the application for the specified needs of the client. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As I mentioned above, the project is still unclear to a very large extent. Therefore, my mission next week is to help me and my companions to better understand the project and the application. For instance, as I mentioned above, try to understand the technical sides of the application and share ideas of how it can be further developed. 
What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
With last week’s work in mind and the sharing of relevant articles, I now tried to further develop the use of scrum in our day-to-day activities. For instance, when we got our client, we tried to narrow it down to elements. As Håkan said on Wednesday’s lecture, in building the best application that has ever existed, we first need to have milestones following our journey towards the best application on this planet. Therefore, I am starting to developing milestones to move the project forward. These milestones will be sufficient for us in seeing progress during the lifespan of this project. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

Relating back to last week’s learning objectives, I can now say that I have developed my knowledge about Scrum and I can now understand it more fully, both practically and theoretically. As always, it can be furthered developed and I will continue to develop my scrum-skills in the upcoming week, predominately by using scrum more in practice as the project progresses. Another objective I had was to understand Github more. With regards to this, I think I am getting the hang of Github and how I create text files etc. Still, more things can be learned and I will develop my understanding of Github by using it more over the coming week. 

Having the project’s scope in mind, which was another objective from last week, I can honestly say that I am a bit disappointed in the lecture that was supposed to introduce the project to us. It is still unclear what the actual scope of the project is. However, what we do know now, is that our client is a terminal and with this in mind, next week I want to learn more about how a terminal operates and how I can create value for the terminal (and thus the client) in the application. This relates back to my answer in the first question, in order to provide a thoughtful approach to the specific needs of the client, I will try to learn as much as possible about the application and its surroundings, both technically and theoretically.  

---------------------------------------------

Weekly reflection, week 3

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Where I am: For this week, I have gained new insights in the project. In connection with last week’s goals, I have tried the application PortableCDM and navigated around in the application and tried to figure out the different features of it. I also read the scenario and together with my team members, we developed user stories on the basis of the scenario. So, I can say that I have gained a better understanding of the project as a whole and in some ways know what to come. The programming environment is really hard to setup, so I will need to get help from our lecturer or someone else.
Where I want to be: For next week, we will meet Mikael, our contact at the terminal. With this meeting we will be able to further develop our user stories and start with developing the application, both through code and through mind maps and targets.
How to get there: To develop the user stories, the group will have a meeting with Mikael, who will give us useful insights about the terminal and how it operates. For the programming program, I will try to get help to sort that out and thus be prepared to start coding. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Where I am: Now when the project’s clarity has increased, I have helped my team to come up with relevant user stories and provided the group with, from my perspective, useful insight in the development of these stories. I have also participated in creating a Trello page for us to use in creating our stories. 
Where I want to be: For next week, I want to help my team start coding and continue with the development of the user stories. 
How to get there: In order to help my team members, I need to be well-prepared and share my thoughts and ideas about this project. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Where I am: I took part in the creation of user stories, which will provide us with useful elements in our approach of scrum. These will help us narrow down the both the scope and help us to structure our work better. I also has been selected as the spokesman for our group, which means that I handle all the communication between us and our contact person. 
Where I want to be: Next week, I want to apply scrum to the coding part of the project as well. This means that I, and the group, will use scrum to split up the work between us and have scrum meetings to share ideas and solutions to the different problems that we probably are going to encounter.
How to get there: I will get there by continuing to support my team and use the same tactics as before when using scrum. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
Where I am: As last week’s learning objectives was to learn more about the terminal and how it operates, I am a bit disappointed as the contact person was kind of sluggish in his answers on email. However, we have made some research (our team that is) and together with the scenario on Github we have made user stories. Also, I have used the application a bit and I can truthfully say that I know more about it now and how the application works with its different features etc. Thus, I have contributed to my team by teaching them, not everything, but some things about the application. 
Where I want to be: For next week, I want to start coding and help my team produce the code that is necessary for us, in order to deliver to our client and his specifications. I also want to help my team in starting to code, both in terms of what to code and how to do it.
How to get there: In order to start coding, I first need to get my program to work. The instructions on the website is really bad (as always with these IT courses), but I will manage. Second, I will get useful insights from our meeting with Mikael and from there realize how I, and the team, will develop our code and what parts of the application that need to be connected.  

----------------------------------------------

Weekly reflection, week 4

What do I want to learn or understand better?

Where I am: For this week, I have further developed my understanding for the PortableCDM application and also for what the terminal, and thus product owners, would like to see in our application. I have, together with Konrad, made a summary of the scenario for our teammates to read and get a better understanding for the project, as well for myself to quickly refresh my knowledge whenever I need to. In connection with last week’s of setting up a programming environment for myself, I can happily say that (after many, many hours) I have succeeded in that case and I have also began to explore the code and how the code is structured in context with the application. However, in regards to meeting Mikael this week, we have failed, as he got impediment and therefore we will meet up with him this coming Monday. 

Where I want to be: For next week, I want to have synchronized our own user stories with those of Mikael’s perspectives and merge those together with the input from the product owners. Additionally, I want to start coding and try to fulfil some of the user stories as much as possible. Furthermore, I would like to, together with the team, split up the user stories so that each and everyone can be responsible for one or some of the user stories in developing them for the application.

How to get there: In order to synchronize our user stories with those of Mikael, this will be carried out by meeting with him and get his insights on what he wants from the application. Also, on the supervision next Wednesday, we will (again) talk with the product owners and check that our user stories are in line with their scope. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Where I am: As I said above, me and Konrad have made a summary of the scenario so that it is easier for everyone in our group to understand the scenario and what roles the terminal plays in the port. Therefore, I have contributed to my team’s understanding and knowledge when it comes to the scenario. Also, I have been communicating with Mikael (from the terminal) and helped us get a new appointment, as he got impediments. In connection with last week’s goals of helping my team start coding, I can say that I have helped everyone (except Adam as he is abroad) setting up a programming environment and also reviewing our user stories with the product owners. 

Where I want to be: For next week, I want to help with splitting up the user stories for the team and also be available to help anyone that might struggle or if I struggle, I want my teammates to be available if I have any questions or need help. 

How to get there: In being available, I will attend the scrum meetings and also be available on our group chat if anyone has any questions or needing help. In the scrum meetings, I will be helpful and sharing my ideas about the project and the how the coding should be conducted. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

Where I am: I have helped my group with the communication with Mikael, the contact person at the terminal. In connection with last week’s goal of splitting up the coding part of the project, I have failed. This relates back to Mikael and his impediments, as we could not meet him last week and therefore my idea of splitting up the code halted a bit. Therefore, this will be something that remains as my goal for next week, now when we have a new time for the appointment. 

Where I want to be: As I said above, I want to help my team in our application of scrum, by dividing the work amongst the members. I also want to continue with our scrum meetings, where we share our ideas and help each other out with whatever that we might need help with. I also will push harder on the fact that every member must attend the supervision every Wednesday, as this is the golden opportunity each week to get useful insights and a lot of help. 

How to get there: As I said above, I will push harder to get each member to take responsibility and participate in the supervision and our scrum meetings. This means that I will convince everyone how useful and helpful these meetings and supervisions are for the application of scrum. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 

Where I am: In connection with last week’s learning goals, I can say that I have gotten all the programmes to work and I have set up a working environment to code in. However, we have not started coding yet, as we are waiting for input from our client. I have also more knowledge in the terminal’s operations and how the scenario works, due to the fact that I and Konrad made a summary to our team members and that also helped me understanding the scenario more, as I processed it more when writing a summary of it. Therefore, I have contributed to my team’s understanding of how the typical process is in the port and also made them more aware of what is to be expected from the application. As I have mentioned plenty above, we have still not started coding due to Mikael’s impediment. However, I have helped everyone setting up their programming environment, therefore I have helped everyone to get ready for the coding to begin.

Where I want to be: My goal for next week stays in line with last week’s, with helping my team to start code and process the user stories and splitting them up. Also, I want to summarize Mikael’s specifications for the application and his insights, so that everyone will be aware of them and take them in consideration.

How to get there: In order to help my team to start code, I will share my thoughts of how the application works and what we will pay attention to in our user stories and how to get them into the application through code. 


------------------------------------------------------------

Weekly reflection week 5

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Where I am: For this week, I have (together with my team) held a meeting with Mikael and his co-workers. During that meeting, we synchronized our user stories with his specifications and what he want to see from the application. Additionally, we got many useful insights in how the terminal operates and what kind of information they would like to see displayed in the application. Also, I have been helping my team in setting up a shared repository on Github so we can code together. In connection with last week’s goal of starting to code, I have started a bit. Furthermore, we have splitted up the user stories and we will work in pairs. I think this is beneficial, as we can take care of many user stories at the same time, and also have the help from the other partner during the coding part as both will be working on the same problem. Therefore, I can say that I have managed to live up to most of my goals from last week. 

Where I want to be: For next week, I want to have written more code and hopefully fulfill the user story that I got assigned. In doing that I need to further understand the application and the user story, in order to be able to efficiently transfer the user stories into the application. I also would like to learn more about how we can cooperate with the other terminal group. That would give me and my group useful insights when cooperating with a group with the same assignment (kind of).

How to get there: As I said above, in order to code a useful user story, I need to further understand the application and the user story. In order to do that, I will read more about Maritime IT and continue to exploring the app. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Where I am: In this week, I have helped my team members in setting up the programs to connect with the Github repository. Further, I have helped Adam in setting up his programs as well as he was abroad last week. On top of that, I have also helped him by explaining the scenario, the terminal’s operations and information from the meeting with Mikael. In connection with last week’s goals, I have helped my team splitting up the user stories and also further developed the user stories together with the information we got from the meeting at the terminal. I have also helped my team in understanding the application, as I have been an “early-adopter” to the application and therefore a bit ahead of my teammates. Therefore, I have been helping them in understanding how to navigate the app and where to find certain information etc. In order to give better help, we have created another communication channel through Slack, where the information exchange will be more formal than on Messenger. Therefore, it will be easier for me and my members to access the information that we share.

Where I want to be: I want to be able to continue to help my teammates with any issues regarding the application or the coding. 

How to get there: In order to help them, I will take the time to sit with together with them and share everything that I have came across. For instance by showing which classes do what and where to find certain parts of the application related to the code etc. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Where I am now: This week, in context with last week’s goal, I have helped the group by dividing the work amongst the team members and make every pair responsible for one user story. This also comes from the fact that we were finally able to meet Mikael and talk with him and his co-workers about the application and their operations. Together with those insights from the meeting, I have helped my team to further develop our user stories etc. 

Where I want to be: In case the division of the user stories seems undoable in a sprint, I will help my team members to divide it into smaller tasks and better effort estimates in the user stories. 

How to get there: Essentially, learning by doing. In trying to do a user story the next sprint, I will see how well our effort estimates will play out and if they are inaccurate I will help my teammates in doing better estimates. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
Where I am now: This week I have helped my team with a lot of things, and many things connected to last week's goals. I have helped Adam in setting up his programming environment and therefore made so that everyone in the group can code. I have also helped in splitting up the user stories among the group members and therefore made us ready to start coding. Therefore, I have achieved my goals from last week, as I also have summarized Mikael’s thoughts for my team and thus helped them understand his specifications and needs when it comes to the application. I have also developed effort estimates for each user story in order to make it more approachable for me and my team, when splitting them up etc. 

Where I want to be: For next week, I want to have transferred the user story into the application as much as possible. In that way I will see if my estimates were truthful and if we can continue to rely on them when planning our work. If it does not hold up, I will try to find the reasons behind the incorrect estimates and correct them for the user stories. 

How to get there: In order to transfer the user story into the application I will start coding towards that specific purpose. When coding I will also see how time consuming the process is and if my estimates will hold or if they are too ambitious. 

---------------------------------------------------

Weekly reflection week 6

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Where I am: During this week, me and Arvid have started coding on our user story that we have got assigned to us. It is somewhat hard to understand all the code related to the application and how certain parts in the code affect the application. However, by coding more and more I have gained more knowledge about it. In context with last week’s goals, I have not yet completely fulfilled the user story. It is quite more time consuming than what I first thought, therefore taking more time in finishing the user story. Furthermore, I understand the application more and more, as the more you code and work with the application, the more you learn. We have briefly spoken with the other Terminal group but we have not yet cooperated in any way. I think it would be beneficial for us to do so. 

Where I want to be: For next week, I want to have fulfilled the user story and started working on another one or helping someone else with theirs. I also want to learn more about how the different states that vessels can have in the application and which one of those that are relevant for us. For example notice of readiness (NOR) is not a state in the application and needs to be further explained by the product owners.

How to get there: In fulfilling the user story, me and Arvid will continue to develop and code for that specific task. In understanding the different states, I have written an email to Mathias, e.g. one of the product owners, and hopefully this will provide us (me and my team that is) with clarification regarding the different states of interest.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Where I am: I have helped my team with doing time estimates for each user story and also breaking them down into tasks. These tasks will help me and my team to understand each user story a bit more and also get a better picture of how to implement the user story in the application. I have also provided the product owners with our user stories, so that we got useful opinions on our user stories. Also, I have tried to help my team members if they came across any problems in either understanding something or having problem with the code.

Where I want to be: For next week, I want to continue helping my team in every way possible. I also want to help them learn something new about the different states of the vessels in the application and how we can use them in our design. 

How to get there: In teaching my team members about the different states, I will share my answer from Mathias and my own reflections on the states. In helping them, I will continue to attend our scrum meetings and the supervision each week. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Where I am: In connection with last week’s estimations regarding the user stories, they were a bit underestimated. Therefore, I have helped my team by dividing the user stories into tasks and also tried to establish a better estimation for each user story. 

Where I want to be: I want to still be on my toes regarding the estimations and try to make them even more correct, if it is necessary. I also want to continue splitting the user stories into more manageable tasks. This will be helpful for the team in developing the user stories. 

How to get there: Same as last week basically, keep up with the estimates and continue to set up scrum meetings and participate in the weekly supervision. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
Where I am: This week, I have mostly been focusing on transforming the user story that I and Arvid got assigned into the application. Therefore, a lot of my deliveries for this week has revolved around coding and such. Additionally and according to last week’s goals, I have also helped my team by updating the estimations as they were a bit incorrect and also divided the user stories into tasks. These tasks will help the user story to become more approachable and easier to monitor in terms of the progress with it. 

Where I want to be: For next week, I want to have finished my user story and have it fully implemented in the application. Furthermore, I want to have started working on another one as soon as the current one is finished. I also want to be able to help my teammates and their progress by continuing to break down the user stories that we have left into tasks. Therefore, our deliveries are mostly revolved around creating value for the end-user and to some extent, the product owners also. 

How to get there: In order to finish the user story, I will need to continue to code and continue to help my team by dividing the user stories amongst us. Furthermore, I want to divide the rest of the user stories into tasks, thus making the user story easier in applying it in the application. 

--------------------------------------------------

Weekly reflection week 7

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Now: In connection with last sprint’s goals of understanding the code better, I can say that I now understand it much better than last sprint. Me and Arvid have almost finished our user story, we just need it to sort by location. Therefore, I want to learn how to incorperate the locations into our user story. Furthermore, during this sprint I have learned more about the states in the application and also made the product owners aware that notice of readiness (NOR) state is missing and they are going to implement that during next week. Therefore, I will stress my scrum master so he in return can stress the vessel captain to use that state in the future, in order for us (e.g. the terminal) to give them ETB’s and such. 

Where I want to be: For next sprint, I want to learn more about the locations and how it can be implemented in our user story. I also want to learn more about another user story, so I can start implementing that together with Arvid. 

How to get there: In order to learn more about locations, I need to explore the code further and check more how the filter works in the portcall view and use that knowledge to implement it in our user story. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now: I have shared my communication with Mathias about NOR with my team and in that sense help them understand the importance of NOR and that it will be implemented in the application. I have also helped my team to further divide the user stories into tasks, meaning that it will be easier and more synoptic. I have also helped my team members with coding and answered questions they had about the code and application etc by being available both for meetings and questions arising in the group chat.

Where I want to be: I want to continue to help my team mates as I have previously in every way possible, i.e. coding and developing user stories etc. 

How to get there: In order to help them, I will attend the meetings as usual and be available to answer and help online through our group chat for example. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Now: I have, in connection with last sprint’s goals of being up to date with the estimations, updated the estimations as good as possible according to the pace we have been implementing the user stories in the application. Furthermore, I have helped my team by further dividing our user stories into manageable tasks for everyone’s comfort and to help them know what is next in doing their respective user story. 

Where I want to be: I want to continue to help my team’s application of scrum by continuing to divide the user stories into tasks and update the effort estimations. Furthermore I want to maintain the contact with the product owners and keep them up to date with any changes that we make regarding user stories. Also, when some members have nothing to do as they have finished their user story (this happened this sprint) I want to be able to help them find new work and reasonable assignments for the remaining time of the sprint.

How to get there: As I mentioned above, in order to continue to apply scrum and helping my team to do so, I will continue to dividing user stories into tasks. Also help my team members to have assignments to work with and so on.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
Now: The same as last sprint, this sprint I have been focusing on coding together with Arvid and we are almost done with our user story. Thus, we are creating value for both the client and the product owners. As I said above, me and Arvid are soon to be done with our user story. As last sprint, the deliveries from me and my team revolve around the creation of value to the product owners and the client. 

Where I want to be: During next sprint, I want to finish the user story together with Arvid and with that bring tremendous value to the product owners and the client. Additionally, I want to start working on another user story and continue the creation of value. 

How to get there: In order to finish the user story, me and Arvid have to continue to code and as soon as we are done, start working on a new one. In this stage of the project, the value creation is key and therefore this is what I will focus on the most in terms of contributing to the team’s deliveries.

--------------------------------------------

Weekly reflection week 8

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Now: In this sprint, me and Arvid have finally finalized our user story and everything works properly with it. The feeling of accomplishment is really great, and I can now more clearly see the benefits of user stories and how it helps the progress in the project. Additionally, I have learned the code much better and how the different parts (e.g. actions, components etc.) work together and where I can find certain pieces of information and so on. That has been very helpful when you are developing your user story. Basically, just by going through the code and trying to connect the different parts has helped a ton in finishing the user story. Also, the help from Pontus (the tech guy) has been very much appreciated. 

Where I want to be: With the last sprint coming up, I want to learn more about the scenario and go through it in our application to prepare for the upcoming presentation on Wednesday next week. In doing so, I will be prepared and also to see if our application has any faults in it. 

How to get there: In order to prepare for the presentation, I will need to understand the scenario and simulate it in our application. Thus, starting to think about how the presentation can be designed in a nice way and to relate it to the scope of the application.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now: In this sprint, the work in the group has mostly revolved around the code and finishing our user stories. As we have finished most of them, my efforts in helping my team to learn something new have revolved around the code and how to implement certain things. We have mostly sat together, so helping has been easy. Furthermore, getting help has also been easy as we have been sitting together. Therefore, in being helpful to my team during this sprint and helping them to learn something new, I have been sitting together with the rest of my team and tried to help if any questions arose. 

Where I want to be: For next sprint, the main focus will be shifted from coding to preparing for the presentation. Therefore, I want to be helpful and share my knowledge when it comes to the scenario and how to perform the presentation in a good manner. 

How to get there: In order to be helpful, I will be reading the scenario thoroughly and sharing my ideas and knowledge about how to make a presentation as good as possible in regard to the scenario and what we have developed in the application.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Now: In this past sprint, my main contribution to the team’s application of scrum has mostly revolved around coding (as I stated above). Therefore, I have helped the team to fulfill our user stories and to provide value to the product owner and the client (e.g. the terminal).   Furthermore, I have continued to help dividing the user stories into tasks in order to making it easier to split up the work among the members of the team. I have also tried to estimate better when it comes to the effort estimation, but these are pretty hard to make as new problems always arise and these are pretty hard to foresee. However, I feel that the more estimates you have made, the more your understanding for these kinds of unforeseeable problems increase. Furthermore, the reflection of previous estimates is important in understanding what went wrong and what to take in consideration when making the new estimation.

Where I want to be: For the next and final sprint in this project, I want to continue to help my team in applying scrum by doing the final estimations and also to attend the final scrum meetings and setting up plans for the next sprint and thus the presentation.

How to get there: In order to prepare accordingly, I need to help my team to divide the presentation into tasks, thus making it easier to split up the work in the team and to get a better efficiency when working with the presentation.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
Now: In this sprint, I have finally finished the user story and helped with providing value to the product owners and the client. It was a great feeling finishing the user story and it was also great that other user stories were finished within the team. Therefore, my contribution to our deliveries has revolved around coding and finalizing the user story. 

Where I want to be: For next sprint, I want to help my team by merging the code to one “project” so to say and be ready for presentation. Furthermore, I want to help my team in preparing for the presentation by doing screenshots from the application and so on. 

How to get there: In order to help my team prepare for the presentation, I will read through the scenario thoroughly and try it in our application, once we have merged it. Furthermore, in order to help in setting up the presentation I will try to understand the scenario as much as possible and figure out the best way possible to present our application. Right now, I think the best way is to do real-time showcasing of the different parts that we have integrated in the application.
