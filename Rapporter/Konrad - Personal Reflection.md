# Week 1

what do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently I have a mediocre understanding of SCRUM, and I want to learn and understand it better although I feel like the LEGO-lab was helpful. Until next week I will read the articles from Emil. I would also like to understand the project we are supposed to do, but I guess I’ll have to wait until wednesday to find out more.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Not really sure how I can help someone else at this point, since we are just starting out and we are at the same level of knowledge about SCRUM and the rest of the project. I would like to be able to help them later on though and will do it by getting an even better understanding of SCRUM.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I set up the Github repository together with with everyone else. We also took a look at different tools for SCRUM. Next time I want to contribute even more and will do it by being even more prepared before out meeting.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
I had no learning goal from last week, since we just started, but will set one up now. I want to learn more about Github, especially what branches are and will do it by googling. I would also like to get better insight into the project we are about to perform, but I will wait until wednesday for that.

# Week 2

what do I want to learn or understand better?
Right now I have a very shallow understanding of the problem we are supposed to solve and the current codebase. I want to understand the codebase we are working with better, meaning the whole PortableCDM repo and all components used for it along with our specific case, the Terminals point of view. I will do this by reading through some of the code and reading the scenario.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel like no one really has a good grasp of the project at this moment. So, the best thing I could do for the team would be what I wrote above; to understand the problem and codebase we will be working with better, so I can assist in explaining it to my team. I wrote above how this will be done.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Since we still haven’t had the chance to meet with our client and therefore haven’t been able to establish a backlog, we haven’t really started to apply scrum fully. Our scrum backlog has no items in it either and everyone is just trying to learn about Github, the project and so on, so we do not have any structured team-backlog for this week, we will have one for next week (two weeks actually since it is easter) though when the project “actually” starts. We do have the reflection of our processes at the end of the week though, which is still kind of weak, since we are just learning stuff and not actually coding. We are starting to discuss roles and so forth in the team thought. Next week we want to have clear roles and a clear backlog and will do it by discussing our strengths and weaknesses internally as well as meeting with the client (assuming we already have a good understanding of the project).

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
Last week I wrote down learning Git as my objective along with getting a better insight into the project. I feel like I understand Git and Github well enough right now, but do not feel like the lecture this wednesday was enough for me to understand the whole project. My goal and path to the goal for next week is exactly the same as in the first answer furthest up on the page.

# Week 3


**What do I want to learn or understand better?**


Where I am: Since last week I got a better understanding of the whole PortableCDM codebase. We still haven’t met the product owner so I still don’t have his perspective on the app. 

Where I want to be: After getting the IDE to work finally I realize I need to get better at coding in JavaScript and learning Exponent. I also need to see how it integrates with Android Studio which I’m familiar with since earlier. Also have a good understanding of the terminals point of view.

How to get there: First we will meet with the product owner, and later I will learn the whole environment by simply starting to code and googling when I’m stuck (or getting help from someone else). From past experience that has been the quickest way for me to learn stuff.


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**


Where I am: I think that I’m the only one who has successfully set up the environment currently, so I will be able to help whoever needs help with that.

Where I want to be: I want to be able to help out whoever needs help with understanding the whole PortableCDM environment, Exponent and JavaScript.


How to get there: Same answer as in the first question.


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

Where I am: I helped write the preliminary user stories together with the team, and also helped with setting up a shared Trello board. 

Where I want to be: Next week will be the first proper sprint and therefore the scrum part will be more important than earlier. I want to makes sure to be able to attend all meetings and so forth.

How to get there: Just keep doing the same as last week.


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**


Where I am: I helped in creating the user stories from the scenario available on the course website. I also got the programming environment to work on my laptop, and will help those who need it next week. Both of these made me achieve last weeks goal.

Where I want to be: I want to be able to get as many user stories done as possible. Also to refine the current ones we have after talking to our contact person at the terminal.

How to get there: I will do this by attending the meeting next week and making sure to know as much as I can about the environment and the interactions before we actually start with the coding.


# Week 4


**What do I want to learn or understand better?**


Where I am: Yesterday, I started playing with the code a little bit to see if I understand it. Together with Emil we tried to reverse the ordering of events for a portcall to see if we could manage it, but we actually couldn’t. Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to do it, but we only tried very briefly. I do have a better understanding of exponent and where android studio comes in right now though. 

Where I want to be: Be able to see which part in the code I need to change in order to make the high-level changes I want and the be able to make changes in the code easily. 

How to get there: Simply by experimenting like I did with trying to reorder the portcall listview, but this time try for more than 15 minutes.


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**


Where I am: This week I helped most of the team to get their development environment up and ready, and recommended sublime as their editor. I also wrote a short summary of the relevant parts from the scenario from github together with Emil.

Where I want to be: Understand JavaScript and the codebase well enough to help my teammates when they struggle with something. Also I will try to learn Git well enough to teach it.


How to get there: Same answer as in the first question.


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

Where I am: I was at the wednesday meeting with the product owners and discussed our user stories with them. Helped in refining these later on as well. Helped plan out the next week and what we want to accomplish before that. This week’s sprint still didn’t feel completely legit though.

Where I want to be: Once again I think that next week will be the first proper sprint, since we are meeting the terminal contact person on monday and will have a meeting directly afterwards.

How to get there: Make sure we have clearly defined tasks for the sprint next week. Make them on monday.


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**


Where I am: As mentioned before I helped my team get their development environments ready this week, which was our main deliverable, since we haven’t had the chance to meet our contact at terminal 1 yet (meeting this monday). Since this was our main user story for this week, I (kinda) accomplished my goal from last week. We hoped to be able to meet with our contact person this week, but he could do it on next monday earliest, so the coming parts are similar to last week’s.

Where I want to be: I want to be able to get as many user stories done as possible. Also to refine the current ones we have after talking to our contact person at the terminal.

How to get there: I will do this by attending the meeting on monday and making sure to know as much as I can about the environment and the interactions before we actually start with the coding.


# Week 5


**What do I want to learn or understand better?**

Where I am: I've gotten a better overview of the code and which parts interact with eachother, although I still sometimes find it difficult to know exactly where I can find the part of the code I'm looking for. I feel like not knowing JavaScript well enough is actually holding me back, and I feel like I have to switch my strategy from last week of just trying to code, to first learn a little bit more about JavaScript (promises and so on).

Where I want to be: Be able to see which part in the code I need to change in order to make the high-level changes I want and the be able to make changes in the code easily. 

How to get there: Learn some more JavaScript from some online tutorials, and also just keep experimenting with the code.


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

Where I am: This week I set up a shared repository together with Arvid so that we can actually work together. I helped some of the team members to understand how that would work, what gitignores do and so on.

Where I want to be: Understand JavaScript and the codebase well enough to help my teammates when they struggle with something. 

How to get there: Same answer as in the first question.


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

Where I am: I was at the monday and wednesday meeting. On monday we made new/refined our user stories after the meeting with the customer (terminal) and tried to prioritize them. On wednesday we made some time estimations, prioritized the tasks and distributed the user stories for the first legit sprint inside the group. Unfortunately the product owners kinda missed us during the "handledning" so we didn't get their perspective.

Where I want to be: Make sure that we distributed the user stories and tasks for each sprint evenly between the team members, and that our estimates of velocity and effort for each user story are as precise as possible. Also still be present during each meeting.

How to get there: Look back next week at our estimates and see how they stacked up against our actual outputs. See which team members have higher velocities.

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

Where I am: As mentioned I set up the shared github repo and fixed our gitignore. I was also present during the meeting with the terminal to get their point of view and most important features. I also helped some of my team members when they encountered problems with Android Studio or exponent. My user story, together with Lucas, this week is to be able to see the ETAs and information about N.O.Rs for each incoming vessel from the first portcall view and also to sort after firstly N.O.R and later ETA. I've started trying to work on that, but encountered some problems, because we need to retrieve information about the specific events already in the portcall view and not in the event view. This is why I need to learn JavaScript better, so that I can retrieve the information I need, using the functions already available in the code or write my own.

Where I want to be: Make sure I finish my user story, and help teammates who need help with theirs. Also help with testing of other user stories.

How to get there: Learning JavaScript, talking with other groups and my teammembers.



# Week 6


**What do I want to learn or understand better?**

Where I am: So, I actually didn't do a JavaScript tutorial but learned it through experimenting. I got a way better understanding of the app by trying to do the user story that was assigned to me, and I feel like I know where I have to look to find the code I want to change now. I've also learned a bit more about GitHub branches.

Where I want to be: Feel like I'm doing pretty well, but I could obviously still improve the speed at which I'm making changes.

How to get there: Not sure, just put in the 20 hours like I'm supposed to.


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

Where I am: Feels like I know the codebase well enough to help my team out now whenever they need any help. I also help with GitHub or whenever they need help with anything else, like exp or whatever.

Where I want to be: Get an even better understanding of the codebase. 

How to get there: Same answer as in the first question.


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

Where I am: I was present on our wednesday meeting and during the meeting with the product owners and Jan-Philip. We went through our estimates so that we could improve them for next week. We also got some good feedback and help from the product owners about finding the state in the app that is corresponding to a Notice of Readiness. We also discussed our process and time estimates so far with Jan-Philip. The sprint was mostly successul but some pairs didn't finish their user stories, mostly due to technical difficulties with GitHub and Exp. 

Where I want to be: Once again, distribute the user stories evenly and have correct time estimates, and keep working 20 hours per week. Also still be present during each meeting.

How to get there: Same as last week, look back next week at our estimates and see how they stacked up against our actual outputs. See which team members have higher velocities.

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

Where I am: I almost managed to finish our user story for this week. It was to get the ETAs or N.O.R into the first view as subtitles. I think I'm only 1 hour short of completely accomplishing this goal, since I've so far managed to get the right timestamps logged into the terminal, so the only thing that remains is to get them as subtitles and sort the list. That's pretty much it. It took a while to make my own function that retrieved the data I wanted from the servers.

Where I want to be: Finish my user story and start working with testing and helping my teammates to finish theirs. 

How to get there: Just put in the 20 hours again.

# Week 7


**What do I want to learn or understand better?**

Where I am: I got a better understanding of the app after talking with Pontus on yesterday (wednesday) about the whole architecture and dataflow (going through reducers, mapStateToProps function and similar). Unfortunately, I couldn't put in 20 hours last week for two reasons. The deadline of our bachelors thesis is approaching so I had to focus on that and I was almost finished with my user story from last week but had to get some help from Pontus to finalize it (the thing about reducers I wrote about earlier). We should slice the remaining user stories better (more independent) so that those who are finished always have something to work on.

Where I want to be: Get an even better understanding of the architecture, like I did after talking with Pontus.

How to get there: Put in 20 hours, or actually more since I didn't put in 20 this week.


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

Where I am: This week I actually helped my group with coding more than working on my own user story, as written before. I'll probably be able to explain what I learned about the architecture, yesterday, to the team during next sprint.

Where I want to be: Get an even better understanding of the codebase. 

How to get there: Same answer as in the first question.


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

Where I am: I was at our scrum-meetings on both Monday and Wednesday. As mentioned before this sprint wasn't the best one, since we didn't put in enought time. I did talk with the product owners about them implementing a N.O.R state to the app, and talking about the progress of my user story. I updated the estimates on my user story, and the acutal time spent so that we can check our estimate accuracy after next sprint (goal from last week). I was also present during our talk with Jan-Philipp about our process, where we talked about what we should do if we put in less time, like we did this week. 

Where I want to be: Same as last week, distribute the user stories evenly and have correct time estimates, and keep working 20 hours per week. Also still be present during each meeting.

How to get there: Same as last week, look back next week at our estimates and see how they stacked up against our actual outputs. See which team members have higher velocities.

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

Wheer I am: I realized that I need some help from Pontus (mentioned in the first section, reducers and so on) to finish the user story I talked about last week, so it wasn't acutally 1 hour like I thought. Couldn't proceed with any other user story, cause they aren't independent so I mostly helped other coding pairs with their stories (goal from last week). Like mentioned before I didn't put in enough time this week, like the whole team, and will cover up for that next week.

Where I want to be: Same as last week, finish my user story and start working with testing and helping my teammates to finish theirs. 

How to get there: Cover up for the time I didn't put in last week, beyond the usual 20 hours.


# Week 8


**What do I want to learn or understand better?**

Where I am: Since last week, I've learned about async functions and promises in JavaScript, which I had to do so I could get the user story from last week finished. I though I was done last week, but I wasn't really, since I had to change the function I wrote to take in and return an array, which made the whole process more complicated since the pinch's fetch method is asynchronous I didn't get back the results, but just an empty array. Anyways, now the user story is basically finished, just some minor adjustments. I also feel like I understand the app very well right now, for the first time, although I've written that I understand it before a few reflections before...

Where I want to be: Since the course is coming to an end I want to make sure that all our merging will be performed succesfully. Also make sure we write a good final group reflection, so that I can take some things with me for future projects.

How to get there: Put in 20 hours. Learn about merging in git beforehand.


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

Where I am: This week I've helped one of our coding pairs finish their user story and another to get started on theirs. Being able to help the pair to finish their user story is what made me realize that I finally understand the code well. I could fairly quickly find where changes had to be made to help them out. I've also helped another team (I think they are responsible for the "lots") to retrieve the correct information from the server, since I had to do the same thing myself earlier.

Where I want to be: Help my team understand merging.

How to get there: Same answer as in the first question.


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

Where I am: I was at our scrum-meetings on both Monday and Wednesday. We once again talked with Jan-Philipp about time estimates and our whole process, the upcoming presentations, reflections and so on. I also showed the progress of my user story to the product owners, and talked about the upcoming N.O.R state, which isn't finished yet. We also talked about prioritizations for the last sprint to make sure they are content with what we will deliver. The time estimates have once again proved to be quite difficult, since problems come up that couldn't be foresighted before, without deep knowledge of the code (like promises and async functions..). I should make sure to initially give user stories a longer estimate until I'm very familiar with the codebase.

Where I want to be: Same as last week, distribute the user stories evenly and have correct time estimates, and keep working 20 hours per week. Also still be present during each meeting. Make sure the final group reflection is well made so we all can bring something into our next projects.

How to get there: Same as last week, look back next week at our estimates and see how they stacked up against our actual outputs. See which team members have higher velocities.

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

Where I am: For the third time I feel like I'm 1 hour away from finishing my user story, but this time I'm confident that it will not be more. I did get to a major breaktrough this evening (after part of the week spent learning about async functions and so on), so all subtitles do show up, now they just need some sorting which should be quick. I helped another pair finished their user story, by showing the how to only show the portcalls for a specific berth. Also helped another pair to create a view and be able to navigate to it. 

Where I want to be: Finally finish the user story, make some final changes to incorporate another user story and merge our code.

How to get there: Put in 20 hours.
