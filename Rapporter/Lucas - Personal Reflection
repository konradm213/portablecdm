What do I want to learn or understand better?

Where I am: 

After a busy week with the bachelor thesis, I’ve been able to get back to a consistent and steady workload (20h). Me and Konrad have put time in and pretty much finished our user story after experiencing a lot of issues. Therefore, I’ve learned a lot about JavaScript though tutorials and Google. 

Where I want to be: 

This last week I want to focus on minor adjustments and not start any new major tasks. After a talk with the product owners and Jan-Philip I’ve gained insight about what’s expected in the upcoming presentation and that is something I want to reflect over. Also, I want to read appropriate in depth literature about the different aspect in the group reflection, to be able to contribute fully to the final reflection.


How to get there: 

Put in the work needed to contribute to my best ability during this last sprint (see above). 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Where I am: 

At this last stage of the project I’ve developed my knowledge week after week and have come to a stage where I can efficiently share knowledge and help others so that we can come up with good solutions as a team. If there are certain parts of the code that me and Konrad have good insight in, we can provide sufficient help to other team members.

Where I want to be: 

Finish my own work as fast as possible so I can provide help whenever needed. By doing this I can help those pairs or other team members to improve their knowledge during this last stage of the project. 

How to get there: 

Keep helping team members and allocate time to pairs that are stuck on their user stories or task. Work closely with my pair-programming partner and combine our knowledge.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

Where I am: 

This week we’ve divided our user stories into smaller tasks, which worked really well for us. I had a more productive week by using this divide-and-conquer technique and team members that get stuck on a user stories could work on smaller tasks instead of just waiting for help. Something that we still have trouble to achieve is accurate estimations on our user stories. I believe this is mainly because our low level of knowledge within JavaScript and coding in general.


Where I want to be: 

Help to improve our time-estimation accuracy and contribute as much as possible in general this last sprint.

How to get there: 

By gaining more knowledge about JavaScript and the code in general I will be able to help make more correct estimations. Attend the last meetings with the group so I can help the group achieving our goals for the last sprint. By analyzing and finding out the different velocities within the team I can help make better estimations.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Where I am: 

From last week:
•	Choose a relevant user story and finish it, finish smaller tasks if I get stuck.
•	Learn more about JavaScript and share knowledge 
•	Attend all meetings

Last week we worked as much as possible, but mainly prioritized the bachelor report. Me and Konrad finished most our user story, except for some minor issued we experienced. After getting understand new parts of the code and JavaScript, with some help from Pontus once again, we finished our user story which is now ready for testing. I also attended all meetings and helped with the group reflection and provided help to the other team members with their user stories when needed. Together with the rest of the team, I discussed our plan with the final reflection and presentation. 

Where I want to be:

For next and final week:
•	Evaluate our finished user story by running tests, make adjustments if needed.
•	Attend the final meetings and contribute as much as possible.

How to get there: 

Put in the necessary work needed to achieve my goals. By working closely with my pair-programming partner and other team members I can contribute to a relevant final group reflection.
