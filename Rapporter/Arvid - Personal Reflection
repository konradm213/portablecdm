what do I want to learn or understand better?
Now: I now have some better experience with merging branches, but it still seems kind of messy to me. 
Goal: I want to learn more about scrum in a bigger project that involves daily work.
What to do: Apply scrum in our next project

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Now: I have helped my teammates to get their views up and working, and by putting our knowledge together we’ve made some great advances.
Goal: To help my team understand what needs to be done in order to merge our branches
What to do: Teach my team the basics of merging different branches.

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Now: This week I’ve further suggested tasks that can used to split up a user story. Furthermore, I’ve helped my team by identifiying tasks across different user stories that are similar and developed a practice for implementing those tasks.
Goal: I want to help my team critically discuss how we’ve estimated our time needed for completing user stories. In my opinion, we’ve vastly overestimated the amount of user stories that we would be able to do during these 8 sprints. I want to have a critical discussion about how we can get better in applying estimation in our next projects.
What to do: Sit down and discuss the problems with our estimations.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
Now: I’ve now helped my team with setting up a new view and side menu items, so I consider last weeks goal completed. My last learning objective is to find a systematic way of estimating user stories that doesn’t involve complete guesswork.
Goal: Find a systematic way of estimating time needed to complete a user story within an unfamiliar code base.
What To do: Look through our earlier estimations and break down what assumptions we were using when making them. Then redo the estimations according to more reasonable assumptions.
