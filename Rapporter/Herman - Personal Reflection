**what do I want to learn or understand better?**
*Now*: I now feel confident in understanding the structure of the app. Writing in JavaScript has now, towards the end, become much easier 
once I started coding and getting familiar with the language. The use of React Native, which was unclear in the beginning, has cleared 
and it now seems like a great tool instead of an obstacle. All in all, in the beginning there were a lot of problems and obstacles but 
they have disappeared for the most part. I now have a set of additional tools to use and learn more about.
*Goal*: The goal is to be able to apply much of what I've learned in another project. This course has worked as an introduction to
scrum, js, react native and expo. I wish to further increase my knowledge about these things and also learn alternative tools. 
*How*: By treading carefully and being mindful I hope to be able to distinguish when to further develop acquired skills and when to
search for new ways to solve a problem. This means having an open mind and being critical towards solutions to a problem. Just because it
is **_a_** solution that does not mean that it is the best solution. 

**how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
*Now*: As much of the project was new to all of us, JavaScript for example, we all basically started from the same place. This meant 
that we all had to learn new stuff and did so quite effectively. As soon as someone had a breakthrough or learned something that
could be useful to the others this was shared. I have during the project tried to be attentive to see what other people may want
help with that I may assist with. I have also shared the knowledge I've gained. 
*Goal*: In another project the starting point may differ among the group members. If this is the case I would want to share this knowledge
so that the work can continue in an effective manner. As for myself I will try to share the knowledge as I learn new things and I will 
try to do so continuously.
*How*: If the knowledge among the group members differ much I wish to start off by mapping what everybody knows. This could help everyone
get an understanding of each other and how to share this knowledge. I will listen to others so that I can get a better understanding 
of how I can help and get help.

**what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
*Now*: In order to be effective in our work I have been involved in our meetings and reflected on previous sprints so that the next one
have been improved. I have talked to the product owners when we needed to ask something as well as in group talking to Jan-Philipp about 
the work process. I have tried to focus more on scrum during the latest sprints. In hindsight I could have been more involved in the
application of scrum and taking it more seriously. As we were mainly focused on producing something of value to the product owners 
we saw scrum as something that had to be done alongside this. 
*Goal*: I want to get better at reviewing and reflecting over past sprints. If a future project requires scrum I hope to apply it 
more thorougly to fully utilize this in the product development. However, I am not too convinced that scrum is the optimal process to
work with. Nontheless I see potential and would like to learn more in another project.
*How*: Scrum, or a work process in general, needs to be applied in the beginning and valued as something useful to the project. By 
integrating the method in the project these can work in symbiosis so that the work gets structured and scrum continuously develops and
improves. My part in this is to be patient and focus more on planning before jumping into development of a product.

**what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**
*Now*: Trying to balance learning of scrum and programming the app has been a challange. I have focused more on coding although I've been 
active in our scrum meetings and our scrum progress. I feel that I contribute in a balanced way which is made easier as we in the group
have a well functioning atmosphere. In conclusion I think that in order to have the group deliver something of value there must be a 
balance between different aspects of the project such as group dynamics, work process and product development. 
*Goal*: In a future project I wish to maintain a balanced work process. However I would want more structure so that everyone knows what
is being done and what the expectations are. As the deliveries relies on having a functional group I want to take more responsibilty
in a future project in order to drive the project forward.
*How*: Achieving a good work process depends on many things. Mainly I think it relies on utilizing everyone's strengths and therefore
getting a good picture of these is important in the beginning. I also think it is critical to trust each other and let things out of 
one's own control.
