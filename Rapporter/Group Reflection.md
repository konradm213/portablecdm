# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 1

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

In this stage we haven't been introduced to the project. We wish to be able to clearly define the scope of the application, including priority of features and definition of the user we are creating value for. The first step in order to do this would be to attend the introduction lecture on wednesday next week. Here we will gain useful insights in the upcoming project, as well as a scope of the application to be created. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

This week we wrote our social contract. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic. 

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. Our success criteria will be based on the project specification, thus this is a part of our weekly reflection that will be further explained in the upcoming weeks.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project and don’t know what acceptance tests are. We would like to know what acceptance tests are. We will do this by googling, reading course literature and attending lectures.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project yet. The design is an important aspect, meaning we will put a lot of time to achieve a design with high standard.

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we know more about the project we will be able to set up some specifications, therefore we want to know more. To do this we will participate at the lecture about the project in order to get to know the assignment. 

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we have a good grasp on the project we will make detailed class diagrams. We will to this by drawing on knowledge from previous courses.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. When we know more about the assignment we can break it down in order to plan the project. So, we will wait for the project introduction and go from there.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project. This means that it will be hard to determine which KPI’s that will be appropriate. Our goal is to determine three reasonable KPI’s that will probably change during the weeks. To get there we need to learn about the project and literature to be able to determine the KPI’s.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

At this stage we haven’t been introduced to the project and we are not familiar with Findbugs or any similar tool. As such, at least our code doesn’t contain any bugs, wihoo! Our goal is to get to know these tools and learn how to use them. To do this we will browse what alternatives there are and be all ears during the lectures.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Since the project has not started yet it is hard to distribute roles within the group. Having eight people working on the same project we would save a lot of time and increase efficiency if we distribute clear roles. Our objective is to distribute clear roles. 

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

This week we’ve been introduced to scrum as a technique. For the coming weeks we wish to get to know other practices which are appropriate to use. Hopefully the coming lectures and exercises will give some insight as to where we are heading. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

We’ve spent 15 hours on the course during this week. Our goal is to put in 20 hours a week with some flexibility from week to week. To achieve this we are going to create an excel document where we can put down our hours worked each day. Also, when we get to know the project it will be easier to schedule our time. 

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

During the Lego exercise we realized the importance of sprint reviews. Although we assume that the sprint reviews during the actual project will be of a different character The sprint review was important in order to adjust the work tempo.

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Version control - Git
Scrum - Github
We would like to adopt the industry standards, and we will do it by researching on google and through course literature.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We haven’t yet had any guest lectures or literature reviews. In the future we would like to be able to relate them to our work. We will do this by attending the lectures.



# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 2

The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
As of now, we don’t have a fully clarified scope of the application yet. However, what we do have is a specified client that we will work together with. In our case, the client functions as a terminal. In other words, our client is responsible for handling vessels both departing and arriving. Today, we don’t have a contact person assigned and therefore we have not made a priority of features, as we are not aware of the prefered values and features that the client is expecting from the application. In the introduction to the project, we were told to create a user story on our own. This, we will finish after Easter, when we have processed the project and its scope a bit more, thus being more full-fledged when creating the user story.

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

Last week we wrote our social contract. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic, as stated in our contract. 
As of this week, we have not yet encountered any difficulties regarding the group dynamics etc. Therefore, the social contract remains the same as last week’s. However, if the group starts to perform worse when the actual project and coding begins, we will be inclined to change and develop the contract with that in mind. Thus, it is something to keep in mind, that if the circumstances alters and the social contract needs to be furthered developed, the social contract is a tool to improve the dynamics of the group. Also, the social contract will work as an incentive for everyone to do their respective work and not to break the contract. Hopefully, we will not encounter this.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

We have as of now been introduced to the project, but we still don’t know about the specifications, other than that it should satisfy the terminal operators demands. As we have yet to be introduced to the terminal operators demands, we don’t have any success criteria. The way forward is to meet with the terminal operator and ask him for his specifications as well as the technical specifications required by the PortableCDM framework.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

We have been introduced to the project, although we haven’t started working with it yet. We have therefore not yet formulated any acceptance tests.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now we have been introduced to the project in a lecture explaining an overview of the problem and some information about what our purpose is. The fact that Easter is approaching and that we haven’t been introduced to our contact person made it difficult for us to start the process of planning the application. Our ambition for the week after the break is to meet our contact person and get familiar with the options we have. Until then we will dig into some of the litterature and read the scenario in the GitHub repository.

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Kind of the same as the previous topic. At this moment we know a bit about what the application as a whole should be able to do. However we don’t know specifics concerning expected behaviour and demands. Our intentions are to map the suggested and wanted functions and pair these with the proper behaviour. To move forward with this we will study the subject and the scenario so that we are prepared to meet our contact person and get the most out of our first meeting.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project. At the moment it seems very unclear in what our task is. We are supposed to meet with our “customers” the week after the easter break. Hopefully things will become clearer at that point, but for now, we do not have a clear enough view to design any class diagrams, domain models, or component diagrams.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project. However, we are only meeting our “customers” the week after the easter break, which means that user stories for now seem to be quite a fruitless pursuit, since we don’t know our task or goal. Therefore, we will wait until our meeting with the customer, and hopefully after that things will become clearer in regards to this topic.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

We got introduced to the project this week but we still haven’t had the chance to get acquainted with the codebase we will be working with or the client we will be working for. We have been reading course literature though and have since identified two potential KPIs, one of which we can already start using. The first one is individual hours per week spent on the project and the other would be a burndown-chart of our backlog. The goal is to put in an average of 20 hours per week during the course period and keep the burndown-chart line as straight as possible, once we have established a backlog. For next week we want to have our third KPI ready and reach our goals with the other two (one for this week, since we haven’t started coding yet). The amount of hours spent is currently tracked in a shared excel file. We will find our third KPI by reading the literature, but we do think it will become much clearer when we know what we actually are going to do for this project.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

Very similar to last week. We still haven’t started coding so we still don’t have any bugs to find. We have determined Findbugs to be a viable alternative though and will be using it once we start coding. Our goal is to have as few bugs as possible in the coming week, when the project actually starts. We will do this by carefully planning and finding the optimal high-level solutions before we start coding.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Since last week we have talked about implementing and distributing different roles. The project has been introduced briefly and roles will help the working process and increase the working efficiency. Right after the easter break we will talk about the distribution of different roles.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Last week we got introduced to Scrum as a technique, which will be our main agile methodology. Some practices were mentioned in the lectures (XP etc.), and for the next coming weeks we would like to find out which of those practices that are appropriate to use.  

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Once again, we’ve dedicated around 15h to the course during this week. As the project is still in its starting tracks, it’s only logical that the full 20h recommendation is not fulfilled. When the actual development and implementation begins, more resources will likely be required to stay on schedule.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

This week, some working time has been spent attending the two lectures given in relation to the course - with the purpose of increasing the base knowledge for the project. In addition, the mechanics of how a harbour operates has been researched, as well as further work on understanding how to optimally utilize Scrum.
best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)

According to “Scrum and XP from the Trenches” a good way to manage the backlog is using a shared google sheets. Therefore we have created one in our drive that we can later start using, though until we have our first backlog refinement/sprint meeting we’re not really going to use it. Apart from that nothing has really changed from last week.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

We still haven’t had any guest lectures or literature reviews so we can not reflect on them. However what we can do is the literature on the course-website ourselves to prepare ourselves for the guest lectures and that way be able discuss/reflect on the differences we find. Once we learn more about the project we will also start reflecting on how it relates to the literature we have read.

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 3

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

Now: This week, connecting with last week’s goals, we developed user stories for the terminal, as the terminal is our client for this project. We used the Trello website in order to create these with a good overview and with easy access for everyone. Due to the fact that we haven’t met Mikael, our contact at terminal, we are not able to connect our own user stories with those of his specifications. For the prioritization, right now, we have made the prioritization following the order of the instructions made in the scenario on Github. Therefore, we will probably change the prioritization for each individual user story.
Goal: For next week, we want to meet up with Mikael and connect our user stories with his own perspectives of what is important in the development of the application. Here, we will gain useful insights for further development, and also beneficial perspectives to be used together with the scenario.
What to do: In order to complete our goal for next week, we will have a meeting with Mikael and come as prepared as we can, to ask relevant questions and to understand his specifications more fully. 

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

Now: The social contract remains the same, as the one we created in the first week. We wish to adhere to the details in the contract. We will do this by creating a very friendly group dynamic, as stated in our contract. We have not yet encountered any difficulties regarding the group dynamics, as of now.  
Goal: We wish to add the individual roles of all the team members in the social contract. This we be useful to for each member in order to remember their respective roles and the responsibilities that comes with each role.
What to do: Just a simple update in our contract, with regard to the goal stated above.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

Now: Our success criteria is to make the terminal worker satisfied with the app.
Goal: We want to adjust our success criteria to make it more specific.
What to do: Talk with the terminal worker and hear more specifically what it will take to make him satisfied with the app.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

Now: We have no acceptance tests as of now.
Goal: Formulate an acceptance test for each user story.
What to do: Learn about the specific needs from the terminal worker. Edit our user stories to make them more specific so that we can properly formulate acceptance tests for each one of them.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now: After reading some litterature we know some more about the scenario and what is expected. Thus we have written some user stories as far as our knowledge reaches. Unfortunately we did not get an answer from our contact person in time to organize a meeting.
Goal: As we haven’t yet had the opportunity to meet our contact person we hope to do that as soon as possible. Then we can double check our user stories and get a better picture of the project.
What to do: Set up a meeting with our contact person. 

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: We have set up a few user stories. Currently we are also setting up the development area to get things running.
Goal: The goal is to talk to our contact person and in collaboration state the functions of the app.
What to do: The next step is as above to get a meeting with our contact person.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project, but we have not yet met our client. At the moment it seems very unclear in what our task is, other than the basic application demo and code we received last week. We were supposed to meet with our client the week after the easter break, but this will apparently be postponed until next week. Hopefully things will become clearer at that point, but for now, we do not have a clear enough view to design any class diagrams, domain models, or component diagrams.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

At this stage we have been introduced to the project, but we have not yet met our client. However, we are only meeting our clients next week, which means that user stories for now seem to be quite a fruitless pursuit, since we don’t know our task or goal. Therefore, we will wait until our meeting with the client, and hopefully by that point things will become clearer in regards to this topic.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

Now: Since last week, we have refined our KPIs. The burndown-chart was scratched since it has been difficult to maintain one, without any user stories. Also, it would be too time consuming to keep one up to date in the later stages. The 3 current KPIs are:
Communication - Although not very measurable, it is critical to our success in our project. The ability to be clear and keep everyone up to date, both internally in the team and externally, will let everyone see the progress which is being made and the individual contributions. We have also just recently contacted the product owner (terminal 1) for the first time.
Estimation Accuracy - How accurate we are with our estimates of the user stories. This is critical since we have removed the burndown-chart. It also allows us to know exactly how much we can do each sprint and therefore also during the whole project. This metric is very useful, especially together with the next one.
Velocity Consistency - Making sure we work 20 hours every week was replaced by this metric (mostly just a fancy name for the same thing). This metric, together with the previous, will once again allow us to be able to tell the product owner how much we can accomplish during every week and also the whole project.
Goal: The communication inside of the team has been alright so the focus in on good communication with the product owner. For the other two metrics, it is difficult to tell since we haven’t had the chance to actually use the user stories we created yet. Judging on how deceptively long time it took to get the environment up and running it will be difficult to get correct estimates.
What to do: Book our first meeting with the product owner and establish a good communication channel. Start working on the user stories next week and see how well we are estimating the times. Also make sure to aim for 20 hour per week.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

Now: Still haven’t written any lines of code, although we thought we would by this time in last weeks reflection.
Goal: Write good code.
What to do: Same as we wrote last week, we will do this by carefully planning and finding the optimal high-level solutions before we start coding, but also through checking each other's code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: As of now, we started to contribute some roles within the team. Gabriel was assigned the role of Scrummaster and Emil was decided to be the contact person of the group.
Goal: To assign more clear roles within the near future to aid our working process. 
What to do: As we get further into the project new roles will appear and our goal is to distribute them in a fair and proper way.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Now: The current main agile practice that is being used is still Scrum and will be throughout the project. Scrum is the framework we use to implement agile development. This week we set up a board on Trello to be able to apply Scrum.
Goal: Learn more about Scrum and improve our board on Trello. XP is something that was mentioned as an agile practice, maybe there is a way to implement it later.
What to do: Read articles to improve our knowledge about agile development and Scrum. Try to find out if any more agile practices can be implemented into our project. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Now: We’ve kept on schedule and dedicated approximately the planned 20h per person and week. 
Goal: To continue working along the same lines as we currently are in the following weeks, maintaining the scheduled level of work. 
What to do: Stick to the schedule in order to avoid pushing work ahead.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

Now: The preliminary user stories have been successfully set up through Trello, but will be refined after the meeting with the product owner. In addition, the first attempts to use the programming software have been made - although so far, there have been problems with getting it to function properly. 
Goal: Next week will be the first proper sprint, so the goal is to finish all user stories for that week, and later do another review of the week. So getting a more complete understanding of the problems and getting to work on the programming.
What to do: Meet up with the client. Understand how to properly use the development toolkit. 

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Trello
Now: We have set up a Trello team where we have a created board with our Product Backlog, in other words we have decided not to use google sheet for the product backlog like we said two weeks ago. 
Goal: We also plan on creating a board for each sprint in the future. Trello will be the main tool in which our team remains coordinated and follows the scrum framework. Some of our internal communication will also be held in Trello though will also keep using our Facebook Messenger group.
What to do: The trello features we haven’t used yet that will help us reach our goals are:
Checklists in each user story with criterias (such as the ones in our definition of done) that we use to know when we can move the user story to the next column in the sprint board.
Assigning members to each user story and task so we know who is working on what.
Comments and mentioning members so we can communicate efficiently instead of always using the fb messaging group in order to avoid it getting too cluttered.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

Guest lectures
Now: During the last guest lecture on Monday we discussed the difference between user stories, tasks and epics, how a sprint board should work, how to manage a product backlog and most importantly how to slice user stories. Most of what was discussed we had already read in the literature and only had to make small adjustments to our scrum but the content regarding how to slice stories was very educational and will be useful for our project in the future.
Goal: Stories should be vertically sliced in way that they are of independent value to the product owner and follow the INVEST criterias while tasks should follow the SMART Criterias.
What to do: Will read a bit more about the INVEST and SMART criterias to make sure we have them in mind when slicing stories.
Also want to note that unfortunately none of us could attend Wednesday exercise in Lindholmen so we can’t comment on that.


# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 4

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

Now: This week, we unfortunately have not met up with Mikael as he got impediments. However, we have still developed these together with the product owners and they are now more in line with their scope. The prioritization remains the same, as we will ask about this on our appointment with Mikael and what his prioritization is. Therefore, our scope and user stories are subjects to change and it will be interesting to see where they will end up after our meeting with Mikael next week. 

Goal: This goal remains the same as last week, due to Mikael not being able to meet and postponing our meeting. For next week, we want to meet up with Mikael and connect our user stories with his own perspectives of what is important in the development of the application. Here, we will gain useful insights for further development, and also beneficial perspectives to be used together with the scenario. Furthermore, we want to prioritize our user stories and start to work with them in the application. 

What to do: In order to complete our goal for next week, we will have a meeting with Mikael and come as prepared as we can, to ask relevant questions and to understand his specifications more fully. Also, we will talk more with our product owners during the supervision to be in line with them and take their insights in consideration together with Mikael’s specifications and needs. Furthermore, we will try to start coding a bit and have something to show the product owners in order to get appropriate response on our work.

**Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week**

Now: This week we have added the individual roles in the social contract, so that everyone can remember their respective roles and the responsibilities that come with them. 

Goal: Next week, we want to add the different parts of the application that each member is responsible of and that will help everyone remember what they are supposed to produce and without misunderstanding between members of the team. It will provide clarity and help us keep track of what we want to produce individually. Also, it will be beneficial in knowing whom to contact if one comes across a certain problem. 

What to do: Just a simple update in our contract, with regard to the goal stated above.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

Now: Our success criteria is to make the terminal worker satisfied with the app. So our success criteria is unchanged since last week.
Goal: We want to adjust our success criteria to make it more specific. Hopefully we can do this as we understand more about our customer and his needs.
What to do: Talk with the terminal worker and hear more specifically what it will take to make him satisfied with the app. Learn about what features he needs and doesn’t need.

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

Now: We have no acceptance tests as of now.
Goal: Formulate an acceptance test for each user story.
What to do: Learn about the specific needs from the terminal worker. Edit our user stories to make them more specific so that we can properly formulate acceptance tests for each one of them.

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now: We’ve given the user stories a first approach and started a dialog with both the project owners and our contact person.
Goal: Our goal is to further specify the design of the application. We want to understand the scenario better as well.
What to do: Next week we will have a meeting with our contact person at the terminal. Then we will discuss what direction the application will take.


**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: Some people in the group have been able to get the application running, which is a huge leap forward. We have started a discussion about what parts in the application we want to focus on.
Goal: Next week we are meeting our contact person. In collaboration with him and the project owners we hope to specify how the application should operate.
What to do: Have a meeting in the group about thoughts to bring to the contact person as well as discussing these thoughts with him.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

Now: At this stage we have been introduced to the project, but we have not yet met our client. At the moment it seems very unclear in what our task is, other than the basic application demo and code we have installed since last week. We were supposed to meet with our client the week after the easter break, but this meeting will occur next week instead. Hopefully things will become clearer at that point, but for now, we do not have a clear enough view to design any class diagrams, domain models, or component diagrams.

Goal: Meet with client.

What to do: Meet with client, then create structural overview of application.


**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

Now: At this stage we have installed the default project app in Android studio, but we have not yet met our client. We still need to meet our client for a better picture, but so far, we have created initial user stories after consulting the product owners and gone through the scenarios thoroughly.

Goal: Meet with client, finalize initial user stories.

What to do: Meet with client, update user stories.


**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

Now: 
Communication - Still haven’t had the chance to meet the contact person from the terminal and establish a communication channel. The internal communication has been going well. Didn’t mention it last time but it is through Facebook’s messenger mostly. Another part added this week will be communication with our product owners, in the shape of weekly meetings during the “handledning”.
Estimation Accuracy - It was very hard to estimate how much time getting everyone up to speed with the development environment would take. Hopefully this will be better next week.
Velocity Consistency - Most of the group worked for about 20 hours this week, or a little bit less, most of this time was spent on getting the environment ready to go and better understanding the viewpoint of the terminal worker through the scenario.
Goal: Have good communication with the product-owners and “customer”. Make the estimates of our user stories as close to reality as possible on monday and put in about 20 hours of work per person for the week.
What to do: Pretty much same as last week, will be interesting to see how well we can communicate with the customer, so far e-mail communication has been slow but working alright, maybe we need to change the channel for next week? We need to distribute the user stories so that every team member will get about 20 hours of work in total for the week. Also take into account that we were way off in estimating how long setting up the environment would take.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself**

Now: Exactly the same as last week, still haven’t written any lines of code, although we thought we would by this time in last weeks reflection.
Goal: Write good code.
What to do: Same as we wrote last week, we will do this by carefully planning and finding the optimal high-level solutions before we start coding, but also through checking each other's code.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: Gabriel is still our team’s Scrummaster and is attending some valuable meetings with Scrummasters from other project groups. Emil is our contact person. Since the coding process is about to start the rest of the group is within the developer team as of now.

Goal: Specify even more roles if possible, and if needed switch roles within the team. Build on our developer team.

What to do: Work closely together to determine new roles if needed.  

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Now: After setting up a board on Trello last week we’ve really started to implement Scrum as an agile practice. Scrum will still be our main agile practice and framework. After next week when we can start our coding process it will be very useful. 

Goal: Develop our user stories and Trello-board, to have efficiency in our sprints and enable agile development. XP is something that was mentioned as an agile practice, maybe there is a way to implement it later.

What to do: Keep improving our Scrum knowledge and use it as an agile practice to benefit our development. 

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Now: As before, we have worked approximately 20 hours each on the project. Most of the time has been spent in setting up the programming environment for each member, as it was a lot of problems to handle in setting that up. Additionally, we (not everyone, but the majority) have been attending both the lecture and the supervision. On top of this, we have been spending time further developing our user stories and explored the code together with the application. 

Goal: To continue working along the same lines as we currently are in the following weeks, maintaining the scheduled level of work. Emphasis next week will probably be on coding, together with the appointment with Mikael and attending the lecture and supervision. 

What to do: Stick to the schedule in order to avoid pushing work ahead and also keep filling out our Excel sheet to keep track of our hours, in order to give a sufficient review of next week when speaking of how we have spent our hours and with what. 

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

Now: Our preliminary user stories were reviewed together with the product owner on wednesday and refined throughout the week afterwards. They will be further refined after the meeting with the customer on monday. We have a working programming environment for most of the group, but this was not shown to the product owner.
Goal: Next week the goal is to be able to able to show some coding progress to the product owners on wednesday, and potentially to the customer, whenever a new date for a second meeting will be set. Another goal is to make better use of scrum next week, by meeting on monday and setting up even better user stories.
What to do: To do this we will further refine our user stories to be more thinly sliced and vertical on monday after our meeting. This will allow us to have some working demo on wednesday, hopefully.

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Now: Since we haven’t actually started coding yet there hasn’t been any need for an IDE or version control system, although it is something that we will talk about and try to set up soon so that it isn’t an issue when we actually start. No changes to our scrum board either
Goal: Our goal is to have an IDE and a version control system that everyone understands and know how to use so that we can work efficiently.
What to do: We need to sit together and discuss how to set these up.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**

Now: We have not had any guest lectures this week so there we can’t talk about it. However we have read some of the Marine IT litterature posted on github.

Goal: We want to know more about the harbor, not just about Terminal 1 works. This help us get a bigger overview and be able to see opportunities where we can collaborate with other teams.

What to do: Read all of the Marine IT litterature.

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 5

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**
Now: As we now have met Mikael and his co-workers, we have gotten useful insights in how the terminal operates and what kind of information and features they would like to see be displayed in the application. Unfortunately, they are not using the application as of now and their knowledge about the app was scarce. However, they still provided us with useful as stated above. 

Together with this we have made a priority list as follows: Change the Portcall view to show vessels sorted by ETA, change the berth view to give an overview of what is happening in different berths without having to click on each one separately, calculate ETB, ETC, ETD and mediate these to other parties, would like to see what type of cargo and volume so the estimation of ETC can be more accurate and readily available upon berthing (talk to ship agent or vessel).
To whom we are creating value are: Product owner, terminal, also all other parties (at this time we think that the ship agent will be the actor with most use of our information).

Goal: For next week, we want to continue developing the priority and features for the application. We will do this in cooperation with mainly the product owners, and also the terminal workers. 

What to do: In order to cooperate with the product owners, we need to be able to meet them and have them look at our user stories and the current prioritization that we have. Unfortunately the product owners left before we could show them the user stories (they left early and didn’t see us) though so we will send them by email to get feedback. However we did not want to wait with our sprint to get feedback from them so we decided to start in the meantime and if necessary we can make some tweaks during the sprint depending on what they anwer.

**Your social contract**

Now: This week, our group moved our reflection day to wednesday, due to the fact that our regular meetings will be held on mondays and wednesdays. Our group dynamics are good.

Goal: Keep up the social contract and if any problems occur dynamically within the group, these will be of interest to bring up in the contract.

What to do: Work together and as stated above, if any problems occur, these will reflect in the contract.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

Now: We have discussed the success criteria that define our application. We agreed upon the following success criteria:
To make the terminal, product owner and course administrator satisfied
Achieved all user stories in the application
Provide other actors with value, for instance relevant data from the terminal in an easily accessible way

Goal: Work towards these criteria, update them when needed and also try to get response on them from our supervisor and/or product owner.

What to do: Keep working and also get in touch with product owner/supervisor to get their view of the success criteria. 


**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

Now: We have created a checklist as a definition of done in Trello for each user story, which defines the definition of done. These are shown below:
It can handle all variations/combinations of input data that it should
The code is clean
The code has comments explaining the code
The product owner approves
On top of that each user story has another checklist called acceptance criterias that describes the things that have to be fulfilled for a user story to be ready for testing and set as done if the tester, who is another person, checks all the boxes in the acceptance criterias as well as definition of done. We showed Håkan our checklists and he said they said they looked good, we only had to do some small adjustments.

Goal: Work towards these definitions of done, and improve the definitions if necessary in the future.

What to do: We will talk about the acceptance tests next wednesday after the sprint review and change them if we feel it’s necessary

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now: We have some initial thoughts of how the design should be made. Below is our initial thoughts of what APIs to use and which architecture pattern to use.
API: One example is to make an API so other parties can interact with the data from the terminal
Architecture patterns: Model-View-Controller, further development will be using the model-view-controller pattern. We will ask Håkan if this is possible or if there are other patterns more suitable for the application and the already existing code.
Goal: Our goal is to be able to have a more substantial design, but this will come from us continuing to code and develop our own part of the application.

What to do: As we have said above, the design of the application will become clearer as the coding progresses. Therefore, it is essential for us to continue with the code and get response from Håkan and the others. 

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: We have made a more theoretical approach to the overview of our application, as the coding part of the project has just started. However, as stated above, we have made a theoretical approach of this and can be read below. 
Examples through screenshots of the application
We want to modify the port call window so that the berths are clear and it shows future ETA’s
We want to modify the vessel window so that you can see the cargo type and volume and click on it to edit/calculate ETC
Goal: Our goal is to be able to have more substantial overviews in forms of screenshots for example. This will derive naturally from the fact that the application will be further developed and as we progress the more screenshots we will be able to upload and show. 

What to do: This connects to what is stated above, as we continue to code and develop the application - the more we will be able to show here. 

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**
Now: As we have not yet any substantial breakthroughs when it comes to coding, we have not yet any structural overview of the application to show.

Goal: Hopefully next week, when we have coded more, we will be able to show a rough scheme of our overview and how we are thinking about the structure.

What to do: By continuing to code, the goal above will come naturally from the fact that the development of the application will provide us with class diagrams etc. 

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

Now: 
We have developed our user stories together with the terminal and are waiting for our next response from our product owners
Acceptance criteria and definition of done: Done, read above
Task breakdown: We are doing these for each user story to be developed in each sprint
Effort estimation: We have done these for each user story. The definition of effort estimation is hours, thus one hour is equal to one hour of effective work. The maximum capacity each week is 20 hours per member. Thus we have 6*20 hours of time to spend each week in total. 

Goal: As our focus will move from the development of these user stories, our goal is to maintain them and develop them further if it is found necessary to do so. 

What to do: As stated above, due to our focus being moved from here to the coding part, we will maintain these and if we are inclined to change or modify our user stories - we will do so. 


**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**
Now:
Communication: We have now met with the terminal workers and we have established our relation with them. Further communication will be mostly through emails with them. For instance, they have given us useful velocities when it comes to loading and unloading of oil. Furthermore, we have also established two separate communication channels within the team. The first one is on Messenger and here we will have a more informal communication with each other. The other is multiple Slack channels for everything formal related to the project. For instance, problems with code, design of the application and so on. 
Estimation Accuracy: We have set up the estimates for each user story and these will be reflected on here, when each user story has been finished according to our definition of done. 
Velocity Consistency: Referring to our velocity this week, each and everyone has spent about 20 hours on the project. 

Goal: We want to continue with our great communication, both within the group and with everyone else outside of the group. After our meeting, our client has been answering much quicker. Also, we will be strict in using our two channels, with Slack being the more formal and Messenger being the more informal. Our estimation accuracy will be interesting to see next week, when we hopefully have fulfilled a few of the user stories. Therefore, they will be subject of reflection next week and connect them with our velocity consistency.

What to do: We will continue working with the coding part and have our three KPIs in mind. 

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs**

Now: As we just have started coding, we have no use of Findbugs just yet.

Goal: Have code available for checking next week.

How to get there: Start working more on the code. 

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: The roles remain the same as previously.

Goal: Continue working with roles that support the project in the optimal way and if the roles are subject to change, this will be done in order to keep the momentum and keep our individual responsibilities.

How to get there: Keep working the same way as long as it provides efficient results. Make changes further ahead if found to be necessary.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Now: We have done general time estimates for each user story, in order to get a better understanding of how to design the coding process and get a better overview of the project from a time perspective. Additionally, we’ve set up a Slack channel to further improve and optimize the team’s communication and decrease clutter (lot of scrolling in Messenger). On Monday we will have a “daily scrum” to discuss how our sprint is going so far. We have 4 user stories during this sprint with two team members working on each.

Goal: We didn’t have time to write tasks for the user stories together so each pair will do task breakdowns themselves, and time estimates on each task once the task breakdown is complete. This will provide more accuracy regarding the stories.

How to get there: The team members involved in a user story may divide the tasks between them themselves. We will try to look at the scrum board during the week and remind each other to do things as planned.


**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**

Now: Initially we had a preparation meeting through Skype on Sunday, discussing the scenario and making a plan ahead of the meeting with the terminal workers. This meeting then took place on Monday, and lasted around two hours. Afterward, we spent three hours in the afternoon setting up Android Studio, as well as updating some of the user stories. Finally, all of Wednesday was spent working on the GitHub repo for the group members, writing the group reflections, drawing a demo for the product owners, starting with a small amount of coding, as well as continuing with the user stories from Monday. 

Goal: Spending 20 hours per week and person working on the project. 

How to get there: With most of the preparation finally set up, most of the work from this point onward will be spent on the actual coding.

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

Now: Today our first real sprint is starting and we have divided 4 user stories between us so it will be interesting for us to see how it goes for us. On wednesday morning we will have a sprint review. 

Goal: Because this is our first sprint it is really difficult to estimate how long user stories take and what our velocity is. So even if we fail to deliver all four user stories our main goal is to get familiar with coding and get better at estimating story points and velocity.

How to get there: while developing we should write down how long time everything actually took so we know for next time.

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Now: Listed all the questions we’d like to ask during Wednesday’s counselling. Color-coded the user stories in the backlog to be able to efficiently track relations in between them, providing an easily understood overview. Developed a repo that can be used with GitIgnores. Instead of having one board for each sprint and another board for the product backlog we now have everything in a single trello board. This will help us get a better view of everything that is happening and minimize the risk of a user story getting forgotten.

Goal: Easy understanding of which tasks belong to which user story by using numbers in front of each card. Get the new repo to work on everyone’s computer

How to get there: Color-coding also the tasks in the sprint board. 

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**
We haven’t had time to read more literature due to other things being prioritized. There have also not been any guest lectures.

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 6

 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**

Now: We got some feedback from the product owners regarding priority of our user stories and how to proceed with development and we talked with Jan-Philip about the scope of our application. He recommended that we use our time estimations and velocity consistency in order to see if the scope is reasonable. We will do that after the next sprint, when we have more detailed data about the precision of our estimations. We are also almost finished with two of our nine user stories. We are mostly creating value for the end-user, but in the process also some for the product owners.

Goal: After we finish our next sprint we want to estimate the amount of work we can do during the course, and that way be able to see if our scope is reasonable.

What to do: We will do this in the way written in the now section. By seeing if we correctly estimate our user stories and keeping a consistent velocity we will be able to see if the scope is reasonable.

**Your social contract**

Now: Our group dynamics are good. We are continuing the project according to the contract. As some people in the group have gotten a cold we are a bit short on people but working hard nonetheless. 

Goal: Keep up the social contract and if any problems occur dynamically within the group, these will be of interest to bring up in the contract. 

What to do: Work together and as stated above, if any problems occur, we will bring them up in our reflections meeting and reflect the outcome in the contract.

**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**

Now: We have discussed the success criteria that define our application. We agreed upon the following success criteria:
Ensuring that the terminal workers, the product owner and the course administrator are satisfied with the end product.
Successfully achieving all the user stories.
Providing other actors with value, for instance having relevant data from the terminal in an easily accessible way.

Goal: Work towards these criteria, update them when needed and also try to get response on them from our supervisor and/or product owner.

What to do: Keep working and also get in touch with product owner/supervisor to get their view of the success criteria. 

**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**

Now: None of the coding pairs have managed to finish their user story, so there still hasn’t been any opportunity for testing. 

Goal: We will continue along the same lines as last week, using acceptance tests and operation procedure for checking. 

What to do: Utilizing the user story checklist presented last week:
It can handle all variations/combinations of input data that it should
The code is clean
The code has comments explaining the code
The product owner approves

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**

Now: We have some thoughts of how the design should be made. Below is our thoughts of what APIs to use and which architecture pattern to use.
API: One example is to make an API so other parties can interact with the data from the terminal
Architecture patterns: Model-View-Controller, further development will be using the model-view-controller pattern. Therefore we can now locate the right files and folders in order to keep the structure of the application intact.

Goal: Our goal is to use the knowledge gained to continue with the user stories in a systematic way. By doing this we wish to write code that can be easily understood such that future developers will be able to continue without too much hassle.

What to do: We will continue with the work we have planned. If something new comes up we will review how this affects us and what changes we need to make. 

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: As can be seen in last weeks reflections, most of our changes revolve around modifying the existing content. We also haven’t yet finished any user stories. This means that the behavioural overview of the application is exactly the same as when we started.

Goal: Be able to provide screenshots or diagrams once we make changes that actually impact the behavioural patterns of the app. The use cases from the app are most likely going to change in the next week, once we actually manage to finish some user stories.

What to do: Provide documentation of every user story we finish. So it’s easy to later show the behavioural overview.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**

Now: With the coding process continually proving difficult, there’s still no structural overview of the application available for presentation.

Goal: Next week, some real progress should have been made regarding the code, which might bring with it an initial structure overview. 

What to do: Finally start breaking ground on the code. 

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**

Now: 
We have gotten responses on our user stories and made some minor changes. The stories are now well defined with all the necessary components. Our effort estimations turned out to be a bit inaccurate. Mostly this is the result of a lot of issues with Expo which took time from the coding. We have learnt a bit from previous sprints and will reflect on this to improve our next sprint.

Goal: As our focus will move from the development of these user stories, our goal is to maintain them and develop them further if it is found necessary to do so. After each sprint we wish to pinpoint the good and the bad lessons learned and bring that knowledge into the next sprint.

What to do: We will continue with our user stories and further break them down into tasks. As the time estimates were not great we will give them a thorough inspection.

**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

Now:
Communication: Slack has been successfully used in order to structure discussion between group members, and avoid information getting lost in group chats. 
Estimation Accuracy: Due to this being the first week of writing code, estimating the workload was mostly educated guesswork. Despite this, the estimations have been relatively in line with the actual working time.
Velocity Consistency: The usual 20 hours have been spent working on the code. 

Goal: Continue communication like currently, as we currently aren’t experiencing any problems. Increasing the accuracy of the estimations, using the previous week’s experiences as new knowledge. Increase the efficiency of writing code. 

What to do: Stick with Slack for formal communication. Reflect over the previous week to improve for next time, especially taking technical software problems into consideration. Hopefully start understanding the API and structure of the code.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs**

Now: We have started coding but haven’t finished any user stories yet. The testing will begin once the first user story is completely finished.

Goal: Have a finished user story next week.

How to get there: Accomplish whatever we are assigned.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: The roles remain the same as previously.

Goal: Continue working with roles that support the project in the optimal way and if the roles are subject to change, this will be done in order to keep the momentum and keep our individual responsibilities.

How to get there: Keep working the same way as long as it provides efficient results. Make changes further ahead if found to be necessary.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**

Now: After a week of pair coding we feel like it is a good strategy. It’s a good compromise between the effectivity of working individually and the extra competence you get from working in a larger group. Working in groups of more than two is probably not something we will be trying soon, but working individually is something we might start doing once we get a better feel for the codebase. The pairs also did their own task breakdowns as they started to work on specific user stories. Feels like the accuracy of our estimates was alright, considering that it was the first week we started coding.

Goal: Do another week of pair coding in order to get a better understanding of the code and be able to quicker help eachother out. An individual approach will be discussed next week though. Get our estimates as precise as possible.

How to get there: Keep going as we did last week. Every pair is free to choose when they want to do their tasks. Keep estimating our tasks so that we see where exactly we are inaccurate in the estimations of our user stories.

**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**
Now: Each pair gathered and worked together with code writing on Monday, although a lot of time was spent addressing technical issues in the software. Wednesday was in usual fashion utilized for writing the reflections and communicating with product owners. 

Goal: Use all of the 20 hours for actually writing code, rather than struggling with software problems. 

How to get there: Thanks to advice from the project supervisor, we finally have a solid understanding of how to use the software correctly. This should enable more efficient time usage for the coming week. 

**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**

Now: The sprint turned out to work okay with a few learning outcomes. The pair-programming worked well and the group met up a few times to share their progress. We have gotten really good at helping each other out when obstacles occur. 

Goal: Our goal is that for the final sprint we are accurate in our time estimations and have a good velocity. 

How to get there: Weekly meetings to discuss how everything is going have been good so far and thus we will continue with those. Also, we want to further improve our reviews and not to soon jump into the next sprint. 

**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Now: We used all the tools from last week. Also we forgot to metion that we used Github Desktop to more easily see which files will be uploaded to our repo. This week we also create a branch for every coding pair. We also found out that there is an expo app for our smartphones. Everyone also has a working repo by now.

Goal: For next week we want to try the expo mobile app to completely cut out android studio, and that way hopefully cut down on the inefficient time we spend on starting up the emulator and all technical difficulties relating to that.

How to get there: Simply download the app and try it.

**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**
Writing code has again been prioritized ahead of literature studies, and there haven’t been any new guest lectures. 

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 7
 
 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**
 
Now: This sprint hasn’t been very productive, since it is the last week of the bachelor thesis and all members had to focus on that. We will however put in more hours during the next two sprints, since it will be the only course that we have. Therefore we can not follow up on last week’s goal of checking our estimates. On the other hand though, we have noticed that two of our user stories are redundant after talking to another group and therefore our scope still seems fairly reasonable. An accurate estimate will be provided next sprint though. We are creating value for the end-users (our terminal, but also for instance the vessel, since they will be able to see ETCs for different berths) and the product-owners.
 
Goal: Not much has changed since last week, we want to calculate if our scope is reasonable after next sprint. This is even more critical, in the last weeks in order to be able to deliver a working product.
 
What to do: Once again, provide estimates before we start, continuously update the time we put in and make detailed task-breakdowns.
 
**Your social contract**
 
Now: Today, during our sprint review, we had a discussion to reassure that everyone fully understands the time required to be put in. Everyone seems to be onboard now and fully focused since the bachelor thesis’ are mostly done.
 
Goal: Adhere to our social contract and what was established during our discussion.
 
What to do: Put in more than 20 hours next sprint, since last sprint was not as extensive as it should.
 
**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**
Now: Last week acceptance criteria were established and are the following:
Ensuring that the terminal workers, the product owner and the course administrator are satisfied with our process and the end product.
Successfully achieving all the user stories.
Providing other actors with value, for instance having relevant data from the terminal in an easily accessible way.
 
The terminal workers have not been checked in with, since there were no presentable changes, but that is a goal for next sprint. The product owners seem pleased, and have even taken our feedback into account and are going to add a Notice of Readiness state to the app, hopefully next week so that we can use it to create value for the Terminal. After having a conversation about our process and scope with Jan-Philipp we got some valuable information that was even used in this reflection. Overall, he seemed pleased with our process and progress, although we did not put in 20 hours last sprint. It was okay for us to put in more hours next sprint to compensate. 
We are on good way to achieve all our user stories, some fell away this week after discussions with another group (Shipping agent) and as can be seen in the scope section we should be on good way.
We are providing value to the terminal and the vessel as mentioned in the scope section. We know this after extensive talks with the terminal about the prioritization of the user stories.
 
Goal: Be able to fill all the acceptance criteria above.
 
What to do: Email the terminal to see if they are satisfied with our progress. Talk with the product owners and course administrator next Wednesday.
Do the estimations mentioned in the scope section.
The email will also show us if we provide the terminal with value.
 
**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**
Now: None of the user stories have been completely finished, although many are very close to being done.
 
Goal: Finish user stories this sprint. Then check the according to the tests written just below.
 
What to do: Utilizing the user story checklist presented last week:
It can handle all variations/combinations of input data that it should
The code is clean
The code has comments explaining the code
The product owner approves

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**
Now: There hasn’t been enough progress made since last week to justify any changes to the design or APIs of the application. Last week’s goal of writing the code in a way that’s easily understandable is continuously kept in mind.

Goal: Continue working on making the code clear and easily understandable. 

How to get there: Commenting and structuring the code clearly.

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: As can be seen in last weeks reflections, most of our changes revolve around modifying the existing content. We also haven’t yet finished any user stories. This means that the behavioural overview of the application is almost the same since when we started. We have added a new list in the menu of the app called “Detailed Berth View”, which has changed the behavioural overview for the user, since they can see more details about the berth view in this section.

Goal: Provide screenshots or diagrams once we make changes that actually impact the behavioural patterns of the app, including the Detailed Berth View section.

What to do: Provide documentation of every user story we finish. So it’s easy to later show the behavioural overview.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**
Now: Not much has changed in the past week, meaning that the situation is still the same as before. There isn’t enough new code produced to need presentation diagrams.

Goal: Pushing last week’s goal one week forward, we’ll try to have a structural overview available by next week’s sprint meeting.

What to do: Spend more time working on the code, finishing the user stories that have been started this week.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**
Now: Two of the user stories assigned to coding pairs at last week’s sprint meeting turned out to be redundant after discussion with other groups. We are re-estimating the workload and effort estimation after each sprint, and updating task breakdowns and acceptance criteria as soon as new information is made available, with respect to the sprint rules. Additionally, some of the user stories have been found to be quite dependent on others, making it difficult to continue with a new user story once the initial one is completed. 

Goal: Finish at least one user story. Have more small tasks available in the backlog to work on once the user story is finished. 

What to do: Keep updating task breakdowns, workload and effort estimation, since this is becoming very important towards the end, so we can finish user stories. If one pair finishes their story and are unable to continue with another, help a different pair with theirs.


**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

Now:
Communication: Once again, slack has been successfully used in order to structure discussion between group members, and avoid information getting lost in group chats. This has shown to be a more strategic choice than our previous use of the Facebook-chat. 
Estimation Accuracy: Our estimations have been mostly accurate, some user stories were shown to be more complicated than others and some team members had trouble to keep up with the estimations.
Velocity Consistency: Since a lot of team members were busy with their bachelor thesis this week the velocity was a bit lower. 

Goal: Put in the time necessary to keep maintain a steady velocity. Maintain our successful communication within the group. Increasing the accuracy of the estimations, using the previous week’s experiences as new knowledge to be able to adjust the estimations to fit the complexity of the different user stories. Increase the efficiency of writing code. 

What to do: Stick with Slack for formal communication. Get our velocity back to normal and stay consistent to be able to improve the accuracy in our estimations. By reflecting over the previous week to improve for next time, especially taking technical software problems into consideration. Gain an even better understanding of the API and the structure of the code.

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs**

Now: Our coding for the user stories is an ongoing process. Our goal from last week was to have at least one finished user story to be able to start the testing process. This goal has almost been accomplished, as we still have some minor issues.

Goal: Start the testing process with some finished user stories.

How to get there: Accomplish whatever we are assigned.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: The roles remain the same as previously. Gabriel: Scrum-master, Emil: Contact person, and the rest of the group in the developer team.

Goal: Continue working with roles that support the project in the optimal way and if the roles are subject to change, this will be done in order to keep the momentum and keep our individual responsibilities.

How to get there: Keep working the same way as long as it provides efficient results. Make changes further ahead if found to be necessary.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**
 
Now: Currently, scrum remains our main agile practice. The process of using pair coding as an agile practice has been going on for a couple of weeks now, and we feel that it is a good strategy. It’s a good compromise between the effectivity of working individually and the extra competence you get from working in a larger group. The pairs also did their own task breakdowns as they started to work on specific user stories. Feels like the accuracy of our estimates was somewhat flawed, since information from product owners and users in the middle of our sprint this week, has implied that some of our coding needed to be thrown away or prioritized down.
 
Goal: Do another week of pair coding in order to finish some more user stories. Get our estimates as precise as possible.
 
How to get there: Keep going as we did last week. Every pair is free to choose when they want to do their tasks. Keep estimating our tasks so that we see where exactly we are inaccurate in the estimations of our user stories.
  
**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**
 
Now: Each pair gathered and worked together with code writing on Monday, although a lot of time was spent addressing technical issues in the software. Wednesday was in usual fashion utilized for writing the reflections and communicating with product owners. We only worked for 10 hours this week due to bachelor thesis deadlines that are approaching. We hope to make up for this in the following weeks.
 
Goal: Use all of the 20 hours for actually writing code, and make up for missed time this week.
 
How to get there: Plan meetings for work during the sprint week.
 
 
**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**
 
Now: Our different groups of 2 continued to work on our user stories. We have scrapped the user story regarding assigning a terminal to the ship, since our product user had a simple enough solution already, by assigning vessels to the favourites section. Since this user story involves creating a complex database with high security that protects sensitive data, Since the cost-benefit ratio became so low, this user story got prioritized down.
 
The sprint turned out to work okay with a few learning outcomes. The pair-programming worked well and the group met up a few times to share their progress. We have gotten really good at helping each other out when obstacles occur. 
 
Goal: Our goal is that for the final sprint we are accurate in our time estimations and have a good velocity. This has not changed since last week.
 
How to get there: Weekly meetings to discuss how everything is going have been good so far and thus we will continue with those. Also, we want to further improve our reviews and not to soon jump into the next sprint. This has not changed since last week.
  
**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Now: Since we are approaching the end of the course, we have not considered it appropriate to add new tools or technologies at this stage. Therefore we have continued to use the same tools and technologies since last week. Our goal to use the expo mobile app has not been prioritized, since Android Studio, although cumbersome, works well, and we have focused more on the code.
 
Goal: For the next two weeks we will try to test all versions of our app, since different parts of the group have their own version of the app. We will then test it as we erge the versions together, which may require new tools.
 
How to get there: We will have to combine the different user stories and app versions that are stable. We may need to use github desktop for this, or we will do everything manually, depending on how well github desktop functions.
 
**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**
 
Once again, we prioritize the coding process ahead of literature studies. No guest lectures have been held this week. Our goal is to try to relate to different studies the upcoming weeks.

# WEEKLY REFLECTION, WEEK 8
 
 **The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value**
 
Now: The three user stories we have been working on this sprint are the ones of highest priority as all of them create value for the end user and have been approved upon by the product owner.  
 
Goal: As this is the last week, no further user stories from our backlog will be worked upon. This is ok though as the other user stories have not been as highly prioritised (according to the product owner) and the user stories will have delivered do create value by themselves. We therefore feel like the final scope of our project is ok now.
 
What to do: Since this is our last week we will focus on making sure the features are presentable. We discussed with the product owners what is most important for them and what we concluded is that they prioritize the aesthetic aspect over the actual performance of implemented features, as it is the concepts that are most important. However this still means that having a general solution that works for various actors and needs is important, so customization when necessary is important.
 
**Your social contract** 
Now: Everyone has been working in accordance with the group’s contract rules, also fulfilling last week’s promise to put in more time than in the last sprint.  
 
Goal: Maintain the same situation as currently, as it’s believed to be working well.
 
What to do: Continue adhering to the social contract, and put in required effort.
 
**The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application**
Now: 
Ensuring that the terminal workers, the product owner and the course administrator are satisfied with our process and the end product. 
The course administrator and product owners were briefed about the progress made since last week. The course administrator provided some useful tips, and the product owners voiced their opinion regarding what they think should be worked on. Unfortunately, no briefing with the terminal workers has taken place due to time constraints.

Successfully achieving all the user stories.
Two out of the three user stories currently in progress are essentially finished, while the third one is about halfway through. 
Providing other actors with value, for instance having relevant data from the terminal in an easily accessible way.
The three user stories currently worked on have been prioritized as they all add the most value to the end user, as mentioned in the scope section. Additional user stories are not believed to be useful enough to steal focus from the three main ones. 
 
Goal: Having two user stories completely finished and ready to present at next week’s final presentation. In agreement with the product owner, the third user story will be worked on primarily in terms of design. If it turns out that this goal can be accomplished faster than expected, we will also start looking into developing basic functionality. This way, it will be possible to at the very least show the intended idea of the view, even if it can’t be demonstrated with complete functionality. 
 
What to do: Email the terminal to see if they are satisfied with our progress. Talk with the product owners and course administrator next Wednesday.
Do the estimations mentioned in the scope section.
The email will also show us if we provide the terminal with value.

What to do: Work in accordance with the goals explained above. 
 
**Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom**
Now: None of the user stories have been completely finished, although many are very close to being done.
 
Goal: Finish user stories this sprint. Then conduct the testing according to our acceptance test and define the user story as done if it fulfills the definition of done
 
What to do: Utilizing the definition of done presented last week:
It can handle all variations/combinations of input data that it should
The code is clean
The code has comments explaining the code
The product owner approves (this one will not be possible though as there won’t be time for this)

**The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)**
This question has been an element of confusion to the group throughout the entire course, as it’s not believed to be especially applicable to this project. After discussion with Pontus, it was confirmed that the choice of APIs and architectural patterns are not up to the group, but rather set by the project’s application. 

**The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)**

Now: As can be seen in last weeks reflections, most of our changes revolve around modifying the existing content. We also haven’t yet finished any user stories. This means that the behavioural overview of the application is almost the same since when we started. We have added a new list in the menu of the app called “Detailed Berth View”, which has changed the behavioural overview for the user, since they can see more details about the berth view in this section.

Goal: Provide screenshots or diagrams once we make changes that actually impact the behavioural patterns of the app, including the Detailed Berth View section.

What to do: Provide documentation of every user story we finish. So it’s easy to later show the behavioural overview.

**The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)**
Now: Not much has changed in the past week. There isn’t enough new code produced to need presentation diagrams.

Goal: In time for next week’s presentation, we’ll try to have a structural overview available by next week’s sprint meeting.

What to do: Summarize what has been done with the app into one version (summarize all branches). Then map out all the new functions that have been made.

**Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation**
Now: Last week’s goal of having one user story finished has been accomplished with margin, as two have been completed. The breakdown of the third user story into smaller tasks has proven to be a smart decision, as both pairs working on those tasks have found the workload to be relatively reasonable. 

Goal: Have the finished user stories tested and ready for presentation, and the third one at least presentable enough to provide the audience with an idea of what final design could look like. 

What to do: Quality check and test the finished user stories. Develop either mockup or actual design for the third user story’s view. 


**The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress**

Now:
Communication:  Regarding communication within the team Slack has been successfully used in order to structure discussion between group members, and avoid information getting lost in group chats. This is believed to be a more strategic choice than the use of the Facebook-chat, which we initially started out with. Though Facebook is still used in an efficient way and is prioritized over Slack, mainly because of the habit of using Facebook.
Estimation Accuracy: Since none of the team members had insufficient knowledge about JavaScript and tools needed for project, it has been hard to make accurate estimations. Some user stories were also shown to be more complicated than others and some team members had trouble to keep up with the estimations. Though we have tried our best to make the estimations as accurate as possible during our circumstances. 
Velocity Consistency: Since a lot of team members were busy with their bachelor thesis this week the velocity was a bit lower last week. Therefore we have increased the velocity a fair bit during this sprint.

Goal: Since the velocity is back to normal, our goal is to put in the time necessary to keep maintain a steady velocity. Maintain our successful communication within the group. Increasing the accuracy of the estimations, using the previous week’s experiences as new knowledge to be able to adjust the estimations to fit the complexity of the different user stories. Increase the efficiency of writing code. 

What to do: Stick with Slack for formal communication and Facebook for less important communication. Stay consistent with the velocity, and don’t make any adjustments to be able to improve the accuracy in our estimations. By reflecting over the previous week to improve for next time, especially taking technical software problems into consideration. 

**Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs**

Now: Our coding for the user stories is an ongoing process. The goal we had for this week was to have at least one finished user story to be able to run Findbugs and determine code quality. After pretty much completing two user stories we decided to use DeepScan.io to scan the code quickly for quality, which resulted in ‘grade poor’. This was mainly because of the original code though.  

Goal: Continue the testing process with more finished user stories, this time try Findbugs.

How to get there: Learn more about code quality tools and accomplish whatever we are assigned.

**The roles you have used within the team**

Now: The roles remain the same as previously and will stand until the project is finished. Gabriel: Scrum-master, Emil: Contact person, and the rest of the group in the developer team.

Goal: Since the roles are not very likely to change, our goal is to provide efficient result with our already given roles and support the project in the optimal way. 

How to get there: By working efficiently with our distributed roles in the same way as our recent sprints. Make changes further ahead if found to be necessary.

**The agile practices you have used for the current sprint**
Now: Scrum remains continuously applied, as has been the case for the entirety of the course. User stories are still being worked on in pairs, now with more focus on user stories broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. All the pairs have also been working together in the same relation, as this makes it easier for pairs to help each other if someone runs into problems. Estimates remain problematic, due to the fact that programming has been significantly more difficult than anticipated. 
 
Goal: Complete another week using scrum and programming pairs. 
 
How to get there: Work together as a group, but each pair responsible for their own user story or task. Estimate how much work can be done on the third user story, in order to realize whether or not implementing functionality is reasonable. 
  
**The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)**
Now: The group has gathered to write code together on two occasions during the week, still working in pairs. The idea of sitting together was decided on in order to make it easier to help each other also in between the pairs. More time than previously was also dedicated to writing the group reflection, as we’ve finally started breaking some real ground on the code and therefore have more progress to discuss. In total, a more time than previously has been spent on the course, which is in line with the goal of making up for time lost during last week. 

Goal: Finishing up the project within the time frame of a normal 20h sprint. 
 
How to get there: Stick to finishing user stories currently in progress, as opposed to starting new ones - fitting the workload to what the group estimates will be possible to accomplish. 
 
 
**The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)**
 
Now: The last week has gone pretty well. During our sprints we now focus more on completing certain tasks rather than user stories, as the coding complexity makes it too difficult for us to complete entire user stories during a single week. This also allows more coding related to a single user story to happen in parallel, as we can divide user stories more easily within and between programming pairs. During this sprint we have pretty much completed two of the three user stories we’ve been working on (testing is not completed yet) and one of the two tasks related to the third user story.
Goal: As next sprint is last one, our goal will be to be completely done with the user stories from last week (including testing etc) but not start on any new user stories as there is a risk we won’t have time to complete them and we also need time to prepare our presentation and write our final group reflection.
 
How to get there: We will spend the next days on coding and then allocate the last three days or so on preparing our presentation.
  
**Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)**

Now: Since we are approaching the end of the course, we have not considered it appropriate to add new tools or technologies at this stage. We are satisfied with GitHub as version control software. As we are pair-programming each pair have their own branch where they are developing the app. It has worked well so far and we hope the merge with the master branch will go smoothly. Our scrum boards we keep at Trello where we have separate boards for product backlog, sprint backlog and a todo-list for things to keep in mind or questions to ask the product owners. We are writing the code in Sublime Text which works fine. 
 
Goal: Now when we approach the final phase we are looking into wrapping it all together. The scrum boards will be reviewed and hopefully completed. The main obstacle we have, though, is probably merging the code in order to get an operating app with all developed functions. Our goal is to have all this ready early so that we can prepare the presentation of the project.
 
How to get there: During next week’s scrum meeting we can discuss the scrum boards and how they have been working. For the merging of the app we need to make some preparations. These include making sure that all branches have working code that have been tested. We also need to look into how we can use Git and GitHub in the best way possible.
 
**Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)**
Now: As previously, the only real relation to the course literature is the continuous application of scrum and other agile practices. No guest lectures have been held.
Goal: The final reflection will summarize the project as a whole, as opposed to sprint-by-sprint. This will make it easier to relate the process to the literature and present a relevant reflection regarding this. 
How to get there: Look back at literature and reflect while writing the last reflection.
